Thus I = iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Think i at this moment acted badly by running away because it won't help me in the long run. But that i is gone and in the past. What can i do now to act better. If you can learn to think this way automatically, you probably won't feel very socially anxious because your self-esteem (BIG I) won't be on the line every time you do something - a conversation, a date, a job interview, but rather only that i will be on the line. (2) To get over your social anxiety, you have to stick with these type of situation. When you runaway, you reinforce the idea in your head that you cannot stand being around people, that it's too hard and terrible. If there are job fairs coming up, attend and force yourself many times to talk to people there.

Thus I = iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Think i at this moment acted badly by running away because it won't help me in the long run. But that i is gone and in the past. What can i do now to act better. If you can learn to think this way automatically, you probably won't feel very socially anxious because your self-esteem (BIG I) won't be on the line every time you do something - a conversation, a date, a job interview, but rather only that i will be on the line. (2) To get over your social anxiety, you have to stick with these type of situation. When you runaway, you reinforce the idea in your head that you cannot stand being around people, that it's too hard and terrible. If there are job fairs coming up, attend and force yourself many times to talk to people there.

Thus I = iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Think i at this moment acted badly by running away because it won't help me in the long run. But that i is gone and in the past. What can i do now to act better. If you can learn to think this way automatically, you probably won't feel very socially anxious because your self-esteem (BIG I) won't be on the line every time you do something - a conversation, a date, a job interview, but rather only that i will be on the line. (2) To get over your social anxiety, you have to stick with these type of situation. When you runaway, you reinforce the idea in your head that you cannot stand being around people, that it's too hard and terrible. If there are job fairs coming up, attend and force yourself many times to talk to people there.

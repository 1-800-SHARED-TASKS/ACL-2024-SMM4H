4gpbsy,run,"you are not your inner critic.. hey everyone. i wrote this a while ago to cope with some real life issues and stumbled upon it recently. i thought this sub might like it. there is an inner critic behind each thought and each word typed out in front of me. none of my writing has to make any sense to anyone but me, but its as if its in my nature to have it make sense for others as well. words are just used to express feelings and thoughts that i have in order to relate to another individual with similar experiences. and so other people also have thoughts and feelings that they try to convey through their words, but i wonder how often those thoughts and feelings get mixed up or portrayed inaccurately when theyre trying to convey something. maybe we all have difficulties expressing who we really are deep down. our inner most self is rarely seen by others. if we can pull down the curtain for others to see our true self we will not hesitate to do it. there must be some circumstances in place to do so. first off you must trust in that other individual completely. if you cant open yourself up to another persons opinions then you will not be able to convey your inner most self to others. you must trust that you can handle whatever another person throws at you. other people are unpredictable and thats flawed other people are good deep down, but their thoughts and feelings can also be misconstrued like ours. we see the thoughts behind our actions, but rarely do we see others for their thoughts. their actions are much more easily seen. their actions are instantly seen and judged rather than pondered like they should be. everyone is trying to deal with their own demons and we are no different. the struggles of humanity come from the same seed of despair. we are all struggling with the purpose of our existence. some seek refuge in faith, while others escape to different worlds through books or video games. there are no surefire ways to live our lives in this world. we are all given this opportunity through the sheer coincidence that the universe has created for us. there is no tangible thing that will bring us the peace that we seek. that peace can be found within ourselves and through the bonds that we forge as we live on. the people around us are also suffering, so we might as well take solace in the idea that we are not alone in our suffering. our scars may look different on the outside, but they all harbor the same feelings of sadness and despair. these feelings pave way to the love that exists only when were vulnerable with one another. its no secret that we wont be on this earth forever. why waste time judging others for their misdeeds or interests when you could be enjoying life? its a pity, really. were all so engrossed in ourselves that we rarely see others for who they really are. theyre all like me. they all have loved ones. they all would love to make a friend who they can spend time with. they all want something to believe in. as im typing this, other people are also living their lives in their own worlds. my world may be different from theirs, but each world is valid in its own right. i dont need to fear the criticism of other people. that brain power can be spent on solving my problems, rather than exacerbating them. the biggest hurdle in my 20 years of being on this earth so far is challenging that inner critic that tells me what i should be. it tells me what i shouldnt do more often than not. it tells me im not good enough to stand amongst my peers and be myself. that inner critic is as real as me, but it doesnt have to be if i loosen its grip on me. when i run that inner critic comes out and realizes it has no power. it keeps saying i cant do it. i should just give up. i dont like this pain. after a while that voice realizes the futility in its words. overcoming that voice in one area of life shows just how it can be achieved in all other areas. persistent effort is the key to any positive change. it takes more than a few words of encouragement to get past this inner critic. it takes determination and it takes time. nothing happens instantly. no real change can be done in a day. habits form and within those habits are the key to a good life.",1,1,0,1,0.00017694276,0.9378103,0.06201282
4vmwlg,"running, run, runs, walk, horse, jogging","just started running - a question to my socially anxious friends. with the new month, i started running again. always has been one of my favorite things. i try to leave the house by 6 am to beat the arrival of people being that i run at a school's track, kinda a popular running area. somebody arrived right when i was leaving which made me feel like they thought i was leaving because of them. plus to make things worse i was laughing when she got there because that episode of friends ""the one where phoebe runs"" popped into my head. how rachel says when phoebe runs ""she looks like a cross between kermit the frog and the six million dollar man."" i was laughing out of control. anyways my question to y'all. what do you do when you run/ walk by somebody on the street. i would go to the other side of the road back when i was younger walking home from school. but that's such an asshole move, or is that just me in my head? what would you do? ps: oh and i'd like to add i run ( and walk ) really fast. this is so annoying because i will get so much unwanted attention. i don't know if its the way my legs are but if i try to run slower i feel like i'm galloping like a horse. jogging really slow is just the most uncomfortable awkward thing. so because of this i will like lap people on the track if anyone's there. just the awkward icing on the cake.",1,1,0,2,0.00019805743,4.8864026e-06,0.99979705

5e1ixb,outside,"studying.. do you guys study by yourselves? i feel like people who are more social and study in groups tend to do better than people who study on their own. it makes sense because in a group, people can all share their own output and one person may be able share knowledge that no-one else knew. for example, i was having trouble understanding a concept for a quiz that i had last week, so i said, ""fuck it"", and went to school early to study in the library and maybe ask for help. as i went to the library i saw a group of my classmates studying together for the exam. at first i was hesitant of approaching and asking for help, but i forced myself to do so because i realized that the pros of understanding the class material and challenging my social anxiety were greater than the cons of avoidance and not knowing anything on the quiz. so i went up to them and said, ""hey guys. do you understand how to do the problems because i am completely stuck."" then it went on from there. after we did some of the problems, we conversed about a bunch of different topics and i actually enjoyed it. i think i still didn't do that well on the quiz but many people seemed to have trouble on the same questions as me. it would've been way worse if i didn't ask for help. one last thing i realized was that for the past few weeks, i've noticed that i dislike being at home alone all the time. instead of skipping class or other outside events, i want to go. i wasn't like that before. i would always dread heading outside. i think it's getting better now though. it's not a rapid change, but i can see improvement and i'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin.",1,1,0,1,4.910418e-05,0.9996716,0.00027929037
5i0sxd,"walk, running, jog","reducing your social anxiety. i wanted to put this together to help as many people as possible that are trying to function with social anxiety, which as you already know, can be extremely hard. i also want to say that in no way, shape, or form have i defeated social anxiety. these are tips, advice, and helpful things that can and will improve your quality of life and diminish your social anxiety. most of this comes from my own experiences and also from what people have said about their own experiences in reducing/overcoming social anxiety. these will not only improve your anxiety but also your life in general. stop masturbating and stop watching porn(if you do): a big reason for a lot of people's social anxiety is masturbation and porn. i won't get into the specifics too much but a orgasm from porn triggers a neurotransmitter to go off in your brain in a very large amount called dopamine. such a large amount and especially at a high rate(if you orgasm to porn a lot) can cause anxiety, depression, among other things. stopping this alone can do so many things. able to talk to girls better, more energy, and being relaxed in social situations are all benefits of stopping this. also if you are addicted to porn and masturbation(which might be you) this may be harder then usual. for most people that are addicted, full benefits are usually seen about 90-110 days after stopping. this is the time is takes to rewire your brain. also the time may vary depending on the severity of your addiction. healthy diet: stay away from sugars. to be a healthy person, doctors say we should only have 37g of sugars a day. to put that in perspective a regular pack of skittles has 46g of sugar. an excess amount of sugar also triggers the dopamine transmitter which as you know, can do bad things. stay away from sugar as much as possible. it is not good for you in any way. try going after healthier things which can have great effect on your mood and anxiety. cold showers: not only do cold showers build willpower, they also are proven to decrease depression and build testosterone, which can help your anxiety tons. cold showers are also very refreshing and can provide you with much more energy. the next chance you get, take a cold shower(not a cool shower) and see how you feel afterwards. i honestly didn't know what to expect but when getting up for school or work, they can take the grogginess away and you'll feel much more capable of tackling the challenges the day presents. limiting time spent on phone/tv: so much of us with social anxiety get caught into this lifestyle where we're always on our phones, games, tv. don't get trapped into this lifestyle. do activities and build hobbies that you will enjoy. start reading a novel. start playing a sport. do something other then coming home from work or school everyday and going straight to the tv. exposure to social interactions: some of us hide away or avoid social interactions or things that give us anxiety. one of the best ways to become more comfortable and relaxed when in these social situations that you dread is by doing them. build your confidence and experience in these situations. greater anxiety in the present is less anxiety in the future. i'll tell you how i am currently doing some of these things. 1. my job: i got a job at monkey joes. if you don't know what that is, it's a inflatable place where kids and families can come to jump around and have birthday parties/gatherings. part of my job is hosting parties. which means in front of 16-60 people i have to host a party. also this party is in somewhat a enclosed room where most of the time people are standing/sitting right next to eachother. i have to give out orders, make sure the mom and dad of the birthday boy/girl are satisfied, help with anything that needs to be done. also i have to speak in front of all these people and let them know what to do. my first party, i was terrified. i've now down about 5-6 and guys, i can't even put into words the difference this has already had on me. this helped me in so many ways like being in big groups, walking into places(like classrooms) with a lot of people and so forth. it's amazing the difference something can make when all you have to do is just simply apply yourself. school: as much as i can, i try to ask questions, and start conversations. i've made so many friends this year that i wouldn't have imagined making a year ago. try to ask questions and talk to people your interested in talking too. join a toastmasters club(when you are ready): a toastmasters club is a group of people who meet up and give speeches to each other to better their skills at public speaking. this is a great way to challenge yourself and anxiety. it's also a great way to become a better public speaker which is a good skill to have. running/working out: not only does this get you in better shape but running or working out can build testosterone and also release a lot of built up anxiety. as you know, testosterone is good for people with anxiety. it can build confidence. if i've had a stressful day or have a lot of anxiety, i'll go on a 30min-hour jog with music and feel tons better afterwards. drugs: stop smoking weed: i used to smoke weed a lot. i think it actually had to do something with causing my social anxiety. i stopped smoking weed and felt loads better in the future. thc is linked to causing social anxiety so watch out for that. not only did this help my anxiety but i was also able to focus on my school and sports much more. my focus in the classroom was also improved. meditation: i, personally, have not tried meditation before. as you've probably heard though, it can do some pretty good things. people have said it's worked wonders in their life. look up good techniques and try them. also, if you do meditate, feel free to comment on your techniques and some benefits meditation has. be prepared: when in school, knowing what the class is about or what the discussion is about gives me way more confidence then if i don't know what anything is about and i'm clueless. i've found that when i'm actively doing my homework, studying for tests, and maintaining a high grade, i have less anxiety/more confidence in the class and also around my peers. don't just do the work or get by with a d. become actively engaged in what's being taught and you will find yourself very intrigued and applying yourself more. limit stress: sometimes, life is very overwhelming. try to get things done beforehand and create a schedule of events/things that need to be done. you already have anxiety as it is, don't stress yourself out even more with things that need to be done. get things done ahead of time to where you feel you have an adequate amount of time to yourself. respect yourself and value yourself. don't cheat yourself by letting deadlines go back and slipping up on due dates. your only digging a deeper hole for yourself. i hope this can help you and your anxiety.",1,1,0,0,0.99998295,3.2152552e-06,1.3773315e-05
5l9a79,"walk, sun","""she'd rather stay alone."". i am visiting a german host family i used to live with. i don't know why i thought three weeks would be an appropriate amount of time spent here. in retrospect, one day would have been plenty. anyway today, the family are having two get-togethers. right now (lunch), they have the mother's parents over. in total, there are six people: father, mother, son, brother of mother, mother of mother, father of mother. later (dinner) there will be some other people, i believe again there will be a total of six people who will stay for a second christmas and until new year's. anyway so as per usual, i'm alone in bed still. i've decided to spend the day doing positive things to keep my mood up as i usually get really depressed during celebrations, and i know tonight at midnight will be rough. so i'm writing on my journal now (while redditing), daydreaming about positive things, i will later continue to plan a project i'm doing, read a book i am absolutely in love with, eat the best food in the neighbourhood and stuff my face, go on a walk when the sun goes down and brace myself for midnight. but anyway as they were about to eat lunch, the father asks me ""would you like to join us? it's totally okay if you say no."" and so i tell him ""i would rather be alone."" in my most apologetic voice. i know the father and the mother are used to my antics. i lived with them for a year, and barely saw them. they know i have social anxiety and have come to accept and respect it. i still feel bad whenever i decline spending time with them but six people, three of which i am not really used to? too much. arg i'm tearing up just thinking about it. anyway. so as he leaves, he announces to the others ""she would rather be left alone!"" and then closes the kitchen/livingroom door. i feel so damn embarrassed and annoyed at myself. it's like i've actually failed them, and they're getting annoyed at me as well. part of me wants to leave early because now it's just ridiculous. i've been here for 11 days and have spent the last four or so in bed all day, sneaking out to eat, shower or brush my teeth only when they're away or too busy/loud to hear me. i hate myself. i truly do right now.",1,1,0,1,4.678127e-06,0.99998176,1.3554541e-05

79e4q8,"walk, outside","story of me beating social anxiety!!. warning: this is going to be a long post. hello, i just joined this sub reddit and created this account just for the sake of getting my social life back in control. before i go any further i would love to talk about where i was 4 years ago. since i was a kid i always wondered why i am i so weird. why can't i do social stuff like everyone else, why am i always scared, why do i stutter when i have attention of a group of people. these questions always were in my head until when day i found out about social anxiety and finally i was like i have the answer. now i can look for a solution to treat my social anxiety. i think i was like 16 when i found out about social anxiety, although i was in india at that time so didn't had much support for it plus basic teenage stuff was going on in life. getting bullied, being ashamed of being skinny which hurt my self esteem really bad, not being able to express my feeling to the girl i liked. all of this made my anxiety worse and i started to avoid people. move forward to the age of 19 i come to new york, i feel now my life is gonna change. somehow magically being in new york will turn me into some confident social bird. but i was wrong, i started college and things aren't changing i am still anxious around people have low self esteem, don't have a gf, skinny sf plus i am developing depression now. on top of that my mindset is changing into a mindset of a victim, i always feel like i am being attacked by people. this goes on for few more years and somehow i survive. now i am 21, fucked up. social anxiety is so bad that i can't even get out of house. i fucked up my semester in college and gpa is all fucked up. all i do is play league of legends whole day and i am only eating like one meal a day. plus i am broke af don't even have money for food. i had it enough i said i have to change myself and will have to take control over my life. i had this burning feeling inside my body which i couldn't get rid of. so i started to taking, i did the following: 1. for first month i practiced getting out of house. i would go carts thinking about how do i get out of house. but i committed to it sometimes i would just walk outside for a minute and comeback. 2. second month started to take walk outside house. my goal was to take walk a in places with lots of people, which is easy to do since i live in nyc. while walking my goal was to observe my anxious thoughts and try not to react to it. i read this book called power of now, where i learned about this concept of observing your thoughts. 3. next i got a job as a salesperson. holy shit that was a nightmare i have no idea how i even survived that, it was just crazy i wasn't event able to talk yo customers. i wanted to avoid that but i had no choice. 4. in college my goal was to ask questions in class. it was awkward though but i had made up my mind. i am not going to live like this, i have to beat this social anxiety. now fast forward to 2017, one of my best years in life man. 1.i crushed it this year, i started my ecommerce business for which i worked my ass off and now i am making decent money. i am also about to launch my own social media agency. plus i am part to so many entrepreneurial communities on social media. 2. last semester i had one class where i would i was the most social person. everyone knew me, i would make jokes and stuff. 3. i joined gym and went from 115lb skinny dude to 140 lb guy although i haven't been going regularly to gym recently. 4. went to tony robbins event unleash the power within! it was really crazy crazy. i am really into self development and tony is one my favorite person i look upto. 5. i went on a trip. 6. i tried to pickup girls, lol. it's fun but it's scary at times. and more stuff which will only make this post longer. how did i do it? i really believe that what we focus on is what we become. so my whole life i focused on social anxiety but in last few years i have changed my focus from anxiety, depression to the person i want to become. i try to focus more on what my goal is and how can i achieve it. also i feel you have to have a sense of like enough is enough. frustration and anger have always been my fuel, they give me so much energy to push myself further and further. do i get anxiety? yes feel it everyday it's just matter of taking control over it. decide if you want to give in to anxiety or you want to win over it. also i recently read something cool about anxiety, instead of trying to call yourself being anxious call yourself as being excited as anxiety and excitement are similar emotions. so by doing this whole meaning changes. although i haven't been doing things i used to do and getting kind of comfortable. recently i started to stutter when asking questions in front of big group so i have start working on social skills again. ask me anything guys. you want to message, do that. i will do anything to help you need any advice. i am here to grow and help others grow. peace",1,1,0,0,0.9997625,0.00012503193,0.000112458954

bmrze1,"outside, walk, basketball","how i got rid of my social anxiety (not a panacea, but things that helped me). first of all, i know this post is long, bear with me. im writing this post to be the message i wish i couldve read 2 years ago. if i had understood then what i understand now, i couldve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. i hope his helps someone out there. even if your experience is somewhat different, i guarantee there is something in what ive been through that might help make sense of it all. **tldr**: i went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. at that point, i did everything i could to figure out what went wrong, and how i could fix this terrible problem. the two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/netflix/reddit/youtube, and increasing isolation from other people. **how my social anxiety developed** a little background about my life. when i was young, basically up until high school, i never had a problem with anxiety. i spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. im 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. i think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than i had. internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and i imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years. i started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. i had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didnt spend much time with them outside of school. at the end of the day i would usually go home and spend time on reddit, youtube, netflix or watch pirated movies and tv shows. my family had some serious problems, so i didnt like to spend time with them. i would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. my family was pretty poor, so id be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. i spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers. i went off to college and everything turned around for me. i was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and i became good friends with many of them. i made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and i had social interaction every day. it became so easy for me to spend time with people. i was the happiest id ever been, and figured id grown from my awkward high school days and i was cured. i didnt realize it could ever be like that again. my senior year things became worse for me than theyd ever been. im not proud of how i responded to a difficult year, but i honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. i was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job i hated. i had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. i became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so i started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work i had to get done. i started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. i became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. when i started missing assignments and classes, i avoided my friends so i wouldnt have to explain. my mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. i numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. i would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. i would constantly be thinking about how i was missing work, letting down my family and friends. i didnt want to open up to anyone. i was incredibly ashamed. i ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades werent out yet, and just lied to family and friends. i told no one that i had failed, just held it inside. i moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where i figured i could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. its been just about a year now since i failed, and im going back in the fall to finish. **symptoms of social anxiety, how it played out in my life** once i moved back home, i took a job where i had infrequent social interaction, and i spent very little time with my family. problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. i would feel anxious when people walked up to me, i would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. in conversations, i would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. i almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. and thats not me being too harsh on myself; ive spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, i understand how i was coming across, i just couldnt figure out how to be socially comfortable again. i was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. this was very embarrassing for me. i became uncomfortable just being with other people, so i isolated myself more. every day just kind of sucked, i was always worrying about how i came across to others, always worried in general. i became very depressed and lonely. started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so i saw them very infrequently. **how i got rid of the anxiety, became socially comfortable again** a big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how i was spending my time. i started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what i was doing. then at the end of the week, id review how the week had been, what areas i needed to focus on, what mistakes i kept making. at the end of the month, id do the same process. i started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere i went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that i wanted to be sure to remember later. i wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. i recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress. i stopped compulsively using my phone, and i cut back the time i was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. all the time i would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span. i found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when i was younger. this was a real problem for me my senior year, and i am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. all that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. i am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, reddit and youtube in particular, was having an adverse affect on my mind. it was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. i started a habit of meditation every day. essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. i cant overstate how important this has been to me. it is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where i can relax, dont have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. i use the waking up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. if you cant afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator sam harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. i started spending more time with people who i loved, who wouldnt judge me. this is the most important part. i was always anxious to talk with people, because i wasnt doing it very often. and when i did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didnt know me, so if i came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. my mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but i knew i needed more social interaction, so i made the drive, over and over. after i spent an hour or so with my good friends, i started to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything i said, etc. the key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. spend more time with friends. i was lucky in that i had friends out there who loved me. i know some people dont have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. dont give up. i started stretching and exercising every day. for me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. obviously exercise alone wont fix all your problems. for more information on depression i recommend the book lost connections by johann hari. it helped me a ton. or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on joe rogan or sam harris podcast. exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. after going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. mind and body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little. i started eating more healthy food. i switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. i figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. im not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant i had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time. **tips for social interaction** when i started spending more time with people, i was very rusty. i felt as if i had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. here are a few things i find helpful to keep in mind. eye contact. i made so many mistakes when i was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. so it is important. where you look says a lot. in general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message i am listening to you, im interested in what youre saying, you are heard. one mistake i was making was i would think alright, be friendly, make eye contact. but i would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, i would think about it too much, i would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact i wouldnt even process what they said. so id give off a message thats very off, too intense, and if i wasnt listening to what was said i had to look away and kind of process after the fact. you basically want to get to a point where you arent thinking about eye contact. thats only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to aplace where it doesnt make you uncomfortable, and you can just use your eyes to convey meaning. as a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person thats talking to you. you dont have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so youre not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. you want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. you dont have to force eye contact. if you arent too comfortable with it, thats alright. as long as you pay full attention to whats being said, youre alright. if you come off a little shy because youre not making a lot of eye contact, thats ok. it gets easier the more time you spend with people. for an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. people tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. theres not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you. what to say. a lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. part of that was i was wasting so much time online, i really didnt have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. in any case, its always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other persons interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. when you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. again, the more you do it the easier it gets. ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. for example, if they keep bringing up basketball, take note of that. ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. or talk about whatevers in the environment, or coming up at work or school. this post has gotten a bit too long, hope this helps someone out there, if you have any questions please post, ill respond when i can.",1,1,0,1,0.00012300129,0.9998599,1.703961e-05
bn4clt,"run, outside","im wasting my time. i just really need to vent this, my head is about to explode full of stress, but i just look at things and i worry why i cant be normal and cant dig myself out of loneliness. just a heads up, its gonna be a long one if you are on mobile. and; i wanna give some background, i live in the uk, sometimes i feel like this place is alien to me, even though for the 18 years ive been on this earth, ive lived here. i felt like i've never truly fitted with people, i dont think i'm an odd person, just my mental health is so poor, its comes off like that. parents always called me a shy kid (i was quieter but i think i'm naturally a more chill person), i don't think that really helped my situation, because i wasn't suffering from it then, i remember still being able to be normal in public up until around the age of 13. i have faced a lot of bullying in my life, sometimes from my own family without them knowing it,up until the age of 16, maybe not to the extent of what other people have faced, but it seemed to affect me a lot more. i will say that anxiety does run in my family, so i believe it is partially down to genetics. and; right, i wanna cut deep into the bullying, i wanna start with my family, obviously i know families have a bit of it, its just natural, but i feel like they instilled fear into me for stuff that did not need it. for example, i still get anxiety from listening to certain types of music in my house incase someone hears it and says something about it, i remember one time, when i had my first phone (i had one before but my parents kept taking it off of me), there were music ringtones on there, i couldnt possibly remove them, they were system locked, my dad finds them one day on my phone, plays them and everyone in the house laughs at me. or another example, which has hit me the hardest of them all, social media, they scared me into not getting, made me fear it cus i was too young for it, i might agree, but they made me avoid it like the plague, until 16, when i got facebook and instagram finally (i had twitter at 13, buts its not really that kind of place, but i still cant bring myself to add my family on there let alone most people i know. in other forms of bullying, when i say i am not an odd person, well i definitely used to be, up until i started college, i was very weird, and was bullied to death in school, people would play 'punchies' on me just for fun, and well, me being a skinny kid, i couldnt really fight back with conviction. i admit, im an emotional guy, and that i ruined a lot of friendships for me, cus if one thing went wrong, id storm off, at least these days im able to battle off that emotion. i was made fun out of in every single way possible, and its beaten every single last ounce of confidence and self esteem i have had. and; to put this into perspective, this is how bad my problems go to; i cant go outside without feeling a strong urge of anxiety, i cant add anyone on social media, even if i know them cus i dont trust anyone and im afraid they will also reject me, they have to add me, which of course, no one will because no one cares (honestly, i feel like i just really hate my area), so ive ended up with only like 30 friends on facebook, similar number on insta, i do have snap, but i think you dont really gotta add everyone on there, since its more of a private place. i feel really incompetent at doing anything by myself, i feel like i have to do stuff for a strong reason otherwise i flake. my anxiety out in public goes near panic attack levels, i wouldn't say i go to that, but i sometimes ill get a dry mouth and body just doesnt want to deal with the pressure, i also cant move my body normal unless i'm confident, which is a more weird quirk thats been given to me by social anxiety. i never had a girlfriend, never even had a first kiss, never even attempted to really chat up a girl, i feel like im gonna end up as one of those people who is in his mid 20s, and still in that situation. i dont even like people looking at my phone, i refuse to pull it out on public transport unless its pretty empty. and; i feel so isolated all the time, my phone is constantly dry, i have tried some positive things, like meeting people online in various ways, a lot of those people i really like too. i've really tried to keep positive this week, but today its just went haywire, i woke up with a real big feeling of loneliness, i just felt the need to cry, i didn't know why, and now its just making me think about stuff too deeply.",1,1,0,1,7.703141e-06,0.9999261,6.62038e-05

(she convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. which, it was, but not all like she thought. this was also good advice from her point of view because i had a lot in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. so leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) i was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me i stop loving her. she deserved someone better, so i made that choice for her. i wanted to be better. i wanted to be someone she deserved. so i started trying to be a person. i went and got a real hairstyle (i use to just use clippers and do it myself.) i started running/biking again. (i have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) i got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. i went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and i just wore running/work out attire. i enrolled in school, which is something i stopped when i went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. in school i started strong, i was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so i could get connections for an internship. then my anxiety hit me, hard. i couldn't finish my resume because i am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. i lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. that caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. my 4 a's fell to near f's and i was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate i knew from an old job and rounded my grades to c's before the end. even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. nothing changed. no one cared. i ended things last november with her. i was motivated to better myself until april. i went to the gym every other day, i ate healthy, i wasn't excited to be back in school, but i did it and took pride in doing so. but the pride in myself diminished to nothing. i still had no one to go have fun with. no one texted how i was doing. i even stopped getting likes/conversations on tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. i am lonelier more than ever, and i have been without close people most of my life. i use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. or teach people english (which is something that brought me joy.) now the only connection i feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes i get on something. i use to be a lurker and only send messages when i saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. i would just tell them i would be here to listen for the former case and that i appreciate them if it were the latter. i use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. it is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. since april i have basically laid in bed. i still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. i browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. i don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy i am. i don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if i am really fooling people. i don't want to be a burden so i don't talk about anything. when my brother's girlfriend asked why i wasn't leaving for classes i told her i missed the deadline to enroll because i was depressed a friend of mine passed away. really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. i would have loved to be friends with her. she was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. i was especially torn up about losing someone that i use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. she was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, i wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. why couldn't the world have taken me instead? i can't find any strength in myself. i don't know what to do.",1,1,0,1,3.0175054e-06,0.99996996,2.6997446e-05

4spxsc,"swimming, beach, swimming","making friends as a loner. just quick facts about me. closeted gay guy, social anxiety, depression, loner. so i see this guy semi regularly. maybe once a week and have/had a little little tiny crush on him. every once in a while we'd have a little conversation. maybe walking the same direction for a bit. him liking women came up organically(just mentioned he thought a woman was hot). that and some tiny things makes me pretty sure he doesn't like guys. so i guess this means move on. i don't want a relationship anyway. i'm too screwed up. too asocial and have no hopes and dreams, lazy as hell and unwilling to do anything to change it. so i guess him not liking guys is a good thing. anyway. post is about friendships mainly so here it is. he told me i should call him on the weekend so maybe we could do something like go swimming and gave me his number. when things are happening my brain kind of forgets to send the anxiety and depression signals (although it absolutely does send some but i feel like i don't have time to dwell on it as much in the moment). so up until i got his number i did want it. i guess it was partially because there was still a chance he might like guys and my brain just wanted more time with him cus i was or am kinda crushing on the guy. but as soon as i got it that meant decisions. that meant over thinking every little detail like crazy. that meant i have to make a decision to call or not this weekend. i hate having stuff to do in the future. if you say let's go to the beach right now i may say fuck it let's go. but if i have to make the decision by friday i will most likely (90%+) spend days anxious and second guessing any decision i make going back and forth between yes and no meanwhile knowing it's gonna end up at no. cus no is easier. removes future decisions and decision/social anxiety. life is just.. simpler alone. i'm so lazy. i read some definitions of loner and yea.. how i feel. . someone that likes being alone . the type of guy who dosen't have good social skills, no confidence and jealous traits. . known as 'the boring guy', the 'friendless' guy, the invisible man. being socially anxious and withdrawn i have little to no social skills. sometimes i think i don't even care. like i can't connect with people. just want to be alone. in groups i may as well not be there. i barely say a word. i'm also stupid. don't know anything about the country or even damnit city i've lived all my 24 years in. so i don't want to talk partially out of fear i'll say something stupid or wrong. i used to have 3 friends. one best friend the other two i didn't hang out solo with much. mainly we all 3 hung out together. that was in like 8th grade. then i moved. i hung out with my best friend still every now and then. then never. i haven't talked to him in years. i now have 0 friends. that's not an exaggeration. i have no people i hang out with at any time in real life. i'm in a kik group where i've known 4 or 5 people for close to a year but that's it. and a friend from the same country on skype that i do nothing else with but watch tv shows. also go swimming? i'm a lil chubby and have stretch marks and self conscious. don't know if i want to hang around half naked with better looking people including that guy - the possible new friend. anything that requires any effort is like.. nah easier to do nothing. i would be okay with doing nothing for the rest of my life. it would get boring at times but it beats feeling like shit. anxiety and depression and maintaining relationships. i'd rather just not have any obligations. not have to act somewhat normal. just be alone. i'm fine with how social i am online. i meet my needs. online relationships are .. here comes that word again.. easier. no having to look and react (body language, facial expressions) and i can just close the app or whatever whenever i want. and it's way less of an obligation(hey at least i'm consistent). it's anywhere from 1 minute to hours depending on what i feel like. actually doing something is hour or so before to get ready and you can't do anything else cus you have to go in an hour or two. it's possibly hours of doing stuff. feeling akward. then get home. it's a whole day versus 20 minutes. the eternal struggle. i ranted a lot huh. also since i only have his number (he doesn't have mine) i'll be the one who has to initiate contact. or just do nothing. which im 99% sure is going to happen.",3,1,2,1,4.984021e-06,0.9999912,3.8429434e-06

ixf77k,"soccer, tennis, basketball, soccer","could it be that i never noticed i had social anxiety, or is it just a temporary phase that'll go away once i figure what i want to do in life career wize?. i've never been a huge social person, but i've always had my 3-4 group of friends at each school i went to. i think primary school was the only place i didn't have friends for one year, but even then, i never felt like i cared. i didn't like group project but i didn't mind them because i usually did them with a friend, and while i was of course nervous in front of people, i didn't feel overwhelmed. i also didn't feel overwhelmed when i had to present something at the board by myself, i didn't like it but i forced myself and it went okay you know. i never spoke up in class unless needed. all my teachers said it, ""too calm"" ""doesn't participate"" but because i don't talk unless i have something to say. &amp;; i never knew what i wanted to do career wise, never. but i also didn't ask myself much. i made jokes and appeared chill, which alot of people told me. it was the whole vibe i gave, and i felt like it too, meaning i didn't feel stressed or anxious much. only time i felt somewhat stressed were for first days of schools, when i moved somewhere else, nervously hoping i would make friend, that i wouldn't get lost, but it feels like it's just common stress you know. after high school, i went to uni because all my friends did and i was good in english so i figured why not. ended up not being my thing. i failed. that's not when the stress started. i then applied to psychology at uni and to a pa course. i didn't even know it was for pa but the diploma seemed pretty basic and quick (2 years), so i went for this one, even though i had psychology in the back of my head for years, because i got scared of how long psychology was. i got scared i wouldn't be good at it. i got scared i wouldn't get good grades. i had to do 3 short interships for the pa course, and i felt anxious through all of them but i managed. i hate calling and answering phone calls but i had to do it for most of my interships and i managed. mostly because i could pass them to employees who knew the answers to the questions asked. but i wasn't very social, and i've been told so. i didn't really go out of my way to talk to the employees. when i finished the pa course and got my diploma. i realized along the way it wasn't my thing either. i don't want to be a pa. and that's when the stress started. i got a small part time job because i know myself and, having not worked alot, i knew i had to go slowly. i did. but it was a job at a pizza place and it also made me realize i have no freaking idea what i want to do. and even if i did, i'm so freaked out now, having spent so much time at home with my mind, that i would be scared as hell to go for it. &amp;; my dog died after my diploma, and he was my best friend, i know everyone says this, but as someone who didn't have real friends beside one who stayed, he really was. i was 7 when we adopted him, he died when i was 23. he was my shadow in a funny way, wouldn't leave my side, and i don't know if this is related. i never kept much contact with all the people i met in schools, only one friend or so. and i don't know if the way i've felt scared of the future, scared of jobs, scared of everything, came because of my dog's death as a way to mourn, or if it's deeper than that. i don't know if it's covid, because i don't feel like i feel anxious about covid, living in a small village, but then maybe i don't see how anxious it makes me. and i don't know if it's just not knowing what i want to do in life. or if it's all of them. i should be focusing on my driving license but yet i can't. it goes to the point where i cry at night quietly so my sister don't hear through the wall. my heart races fast most of the time, my feet fidget most of the time, i'm constantly thinking about career, career, career. but i'm incapable, or i feel so at least, of doing anything. i feel like i'm scared of going out of my comfort zone, of meeting people, of going outside, of having responsabilities when i feel so immature. i don't want a job, but i have to no? i remember having a fear of my parents dying at something like 11 years old. but it passed and i got over it, yet right now it's back again but it's worse because i'm older and they're older and i haven't figured shit out yet. when my mom took me to soccer, tennis, basketball and all that; i had no problem with it. but now that i had the idea of starting soccer again, i felt so scared and anxious of calling by myself like an adult that i just didn't do it? i wanted to learn piano recently, never called. i got so anxious when i got phone calls for jobs, or for interviews, i literally had to write what i was gonna say on my phone? i never cared about phones calls younger, so why? when i started the pa course, i didn't freak out this much at the aspect of going to a new school in a place i knew nothing about, so why didn't i go for psychology this year because i got scared of going back to school again? it's just so frustrating. i guess i'm posting again here, because i don't know who else to tell. what if i'm just making up those feelings all in my head? what if i'm just being a crybaby when so many people have it worse. i know we shouldn't compare, but i feel like ""what if i'm overexagerating my feelings and i'm not actually anxious/nervous but i made it all up in my head and convinced myself i was while some people actually suffer from it?"" i feel anxious, i feel incapable or having responsabilities, immature, i feel scared. but am i?

df5bs2b,"run, walk","if your mom gets mad at you for trying to talk about your problems i'd try and take a different approach to telling her. the best thing you can do is try and stay calm even if she gets mad at you. try and approach her when she's in a good mood. you can even do something for her (such as making her coffee) to try and create a good atmosphere before you talk to her. do your best to open up to her as much as you can. i don't know anything about you, but a few years ago i'd never have imagined telling my mum about my problems in detail. maybe you feel this way too, maybe it seems impossible, but once it's done it is worth it. go into detail and tell her how you feel about it. if she has empathy she will listen and try to understand your point of view. now i know everybodys gonna say your still young its normal for you to be like this... as someone a few years older than you, i found out around your age that everyone has their own problems they deal with. i didn't believe it at the time; it took me a while to realise it but everyone has their own unique problems and their confidence is all an act. while potheads, sex addicts and bullies and all this shit get to live the fun, free life without worry of what tbey do next the majority of people who lead this sort of life will end up regretting it in the long run. most of these sorts of people i knew at 15/16 ended up with a low paid/no job at 18 and no skills and no ambition to make a change. you're at the point of your life where you can focus on your future. change doesn't happen overnight, not even in a week, not in a month, heck you'd be lucky to change your life around in a year. but at your age you have a massive opportunity. focus on your future. think about what you want to achieve, what kind of lifestyle you want to lead. be realistic, but be ambitious. some of your problems will follow you for many months or many years but you need to have a drive to overcome them. your best option would be to think about what you want to do in the future and how you can work towards it in the next year. do you want to continue school? then probably consider moving schools once the academic year is finished. think about apprentiship/training schemes or college courses you might want to do, or think about a job you want to get. focus on something you know you enjoy. this is because i always feel like i walk weird, have a very asymetrical face (ugly), underdeveloped jaw, i run weird my whole body just doesnt look right. i have confidence in my body i had a workout addiction i just dont think its all in proportion, im scared to do stuff because it just doesnt ever look right when i do it. im always judging myself probably a habit im just not used to going days without torment. pretend you're an actor. i don't mean that you should try to change the way you look or to try and do everything perfectly, but put yourself in the mindset of an actor. your new role is to play a confident, good looking guy who knows he looks great and will be a great person. when you have a negative thought about yourself, go into acting mode and pretend you're the guy everyone likes and wants to be. if you're looking in the mirror and don't like what you see, change the scene. change the lighting in the room, the angle you're facing or the distance you are from the mirror until you think 'maybe i don't look too bad'. because you don't look at someone else and study them up close for hours on end and find all of their flaws. other people look at you from a distance and don't see your flaws, just like you don't notice all of theirs. believe me the reason you look at yourself and think that you're ugly is psychological and if you start acting the role of the guy you want to be, you will realise that you're actually not too far off.",3,1,2,1,0.0006691813,0.99930775,2.305395e-05

qf2uhn,"outside , soccer, soccer","i am doing an exchange year but my social anxiety is making my mental health here pretty bad and i kind of regret my decision.... hi:) ok, so this is probably gonna be a very long post.. sorry about that. so i (16f) am from germany but i am currently doing an exchange year in texas and going to a high school here. i've always struggled with social anxiety and it has always made my life a little bit harder. but overall and especially since acknowledging it i was able to get along with it fine. and although i struggled with my friends situation in germany too, i was at a point where i was pretty comfortable. i had 3 close friends (although 1 maybe not as much anymore and i only very regularly met up with one of them), i felt comfortable in school and in my class since i had been in the same class with the same people for 5 years, i had a good relationship with my parents and siblings (although looking back now i definitely didnt appreciate and acknowledge them enough) and i was just overall doing ok i guess. so i always wanted to do an exchange year and decided to actually do it and go to school in the us for 10 months. i was really excited about it and thought going specifically to the us would help me get more open and overcome my social anxiety since the people here are known for being very open. i thought about it a lot and imagined how my life here would be. everyone i ever heard of told me that doing an exchange year was the best decision and one if not the best year of their lives. so i felt encouraged and i felt confident i could do it. i knew that this would be a very big challenge for my social anxiety but since my english was already very good and i was basically already fluent i decided that would make it one challenge less and i would be able to jump over my shadow and do this. well i have been here for 3 months now and it is just so much harder than i ever could have imagined, i cry myself to sleep a lot and my mental health overall and my social anxiety is just much worse than it was at home. i live in a host family here and i do get along with them pretty well in general and besides the fact that living with a family you never knew before, of course, is very weird i would say i have gotten used to living here, and rather comfortable. the only thing giving me a lot of issues here are the kids. the little girl is just not respecting my boundaries at all and tries to hug me every time she gets the chance to, even though and because she knows that i do not like hugs and they make me uncomfortable. that's just one thing but i'm not really gonna get into the other reasons here. so as i said i am a senior at a high school here. so as you might imagine i don't really have any friends. the only friend group that i have here are the other exchange students but that is just a little bit different because we're going through the same thing of course and i didn't really have to do anything myself to get these friends yk and a lot actually like went through my host sister (i have a double placement which means there is another exchange student living in my house and without her i probably would not survive this here at all (the kids and just everything in general). i don't really have any classes with them though besides one class i have with my host sister. in this class, we have 2 friends but as you might imagine i wasn't the one that like initiated that and we don't meet them like outside of school. i don't have any friends in any of my other classes because i am just mentally (it feels like it's physically) not able to take the first step and start talking to people and then keeping it going. before coming here i kind of thought everyone would know i'm not from here and be interested in talking to me, which is pretty naive to think but that's what i heard from some former exchange students. well, my school here is huge (2770 students, for comparison my german school roughly has 600) and no one is interested in talking to me. and if they are then they ask like 2 questions and then they're not interested anymore. and i guess my accent also is not strong enough for people to know i'm not from here. also, they are probably used to people not speaking perfect english since we have a lot of students coming from mexico at my school that only speak spanish and a little bit of english. our school has a and b days and 4 classes per day. a day is the day where i have forensic science with my host sister which makes it an ok day but still in the other classes i pretty much just quietly does my work alone. well, b-day is way worse i quietly do my work the whole day since i don't have any friends or people talking to me on that day. i also have my less favorite classes on b-day. so i just kind of exist and get through with these school days but i never really have fun in school. and i mean i came here to experience the american high school so it makes me feel so bad and guilty and like i'm wasting time and i'm just not really happy in school here. most exchange students say to join a club or a sport and that that will make it very easy to find friends, so since i already played a little bit of soccer in germany i joined the soccer team. sadly that didn't help me either and it just kind of feels a little awkward a lot of the time. this whole thing is just being really bad for my mental health, i cry a looot here and i'm just not really that happy here and i just want to be home so often. i have friends that are doing an exchange year as well and seeing all their stories and talking to them and hearing about how happy they are here and how ist the best year of their lives and they don't want to leave and just only see them having like a lot of friends just hurts e a lot and makes me feel so bad. i've already unfollowed every exchange student i am not personally friends with but it is still very hard. one of my best friends (the one i meet more often) is doing an exchange year as well and she is the only one i ever really open up to about my social anxiety since she also has an anxiety disorder and can relate a lot better and i don't know why but she is just the only one i feel comfortable talking to about my struggles. so for her ist pretty much the opposite and her mental health got so much better being here and hearing from her just hurts so much too. and she tries to help me but i just feel like right now i have no one that can relate to me and really understand me and i'm just t not really a person that opens up easily which means i'm not really comfortable opening up to anyone. and now my birthday is in like 2 weeks and i just don't know how i'm supposed to be able to feel happy on my birthday in this situation when it's gonna be my first birthday ever without my family and also without my twin sister who is doing an exchange year as well (which makes me compare mine to hers as well too of course and it's really hard to see her be so happy too). and of course, i'm happy for all my friends and that they are having such an amazing time but i am just not and that makes it so difficult for me to feel happy for them. i just don't know what to do anymore and how i'm supposed to make it through the next 7 months. and don't get me wrong of course there are still happy moments here like when i'm hanging out with the other exchange students but otherwise i just kind of regret my exchange year a little bit. and also every you do have a local coordinator from the agency that is supposed to talk to you regularly and just help you with things but mine is just not that present. technically she is supposed to talk to us like once every 2 weeks and meet us at least once a month but i have only seen and talked to my local coordinator once for like 10 minutes after the first month. she was also supposed to give us an orientation where she goes over rules advice etc when we got here but she never did that either. so although she does seem like a nice person she's just so busy with her own family and her job she doesn't really do her job as a local coordinator that well and it just doesn't make me comfortable enough to talk to her about this. sorry, this was so long but i just kind of needed to rant about this and let it all out somewhere, and maybe one of you has some advice for me",2,1,1,2,0.0012885382,0.055226356,0.9434851

so that's a success hurray for me! they introduced me to a random girl they saw and became my first girlfriend, second success. not to go into details but she was my ""first"" of a lot of things...3rd success? does it count if she dumped me within a week to focus on studies?.... i like to think so... we'll call that a half success i guess? the first day of college i told myself i'll talk to the first person that catches my eye at all, it was a girl with a backpack that had a bunch of eeveelutions on it from pokemon. we talked the entire walk from the dorms to our classes. she dyed her hair red afterwards so she's not the most eye catcher of them all because i really like dyed hair and stuff... it's cool. i seen her around multiple times while hanging out friends and/or doing college stuff but i haven't had the courage to talk to her again because either she's with friends, or i'm not in the right state to talk to her without freaking out. than one day me and one of my friends go to the cafe for lunch and boom there she is talking to a friend. i start rambling to my friend the numerous reasons why i shouldn't talk to her. she has a friend. what if she's not interested? what if she's not interested in men??? it'll look weird. i ended up tricking myself into sitting next to her and talking to her until they left because they were just about to leave before i sat down, that's like what? 3.5 successes? she stayed longer to talk from what i thought. when she got up i panicked and asked ""hey we should exchange numbers so we can chat some more?"" she gave me her number and left and for the walk back to my dorm i was on top of the world........ it was fake btw. i see her everyday and it freaks me out now because of the number thing, so much that my friends warn me and give me cover ups to not confront her. is that even a helpful thing? because a part of my mind is very small and says ""m-maybe she didn't mean to."" a slightly louder voice says ""maybe there's still hope if just keep idle chit chat when you see here and wait until she asks for your number or something."" than there's a really loud screaming voice that well... screams ""you blew it!!! or you never had it to blow in the first face!!!"" today though i was in my solar system class and i saw this girl there that i found was really cute and... ok this is gonna sound weird because it's like a class thing but the way she said woden and could name all the germanic gods was impressive for me... not the saying woden thing that was a part of the cute thing. so i saw that she was right next to me walking out so i talked to her for a bit, didn't catch her name but we have the same class so it's like no rush, don't want to mess things up like with red hair... did i mention she had the same name and major as my ex gf i previously mentioned? anyways so that's another opposite gender i talked to, 4.5 success! man typing this is really helping me feel so much better about myself. so here's the part where i get down again because i have to revisit it yaaaaay~ i was walking back to my dorm when i see the divine light from the sun bounce off the fiery scarlet mane of someone in front of me. i know we'll be going the same way for almost the entire walk. so i make a quick cross of the road to be on the other side than her. that helped me but than i remembered the path we take, where now she'll cross the road soon and since i'm on the other side it'll be a direct collision instead of just me walking a few yards behind her as i would of earlier. this made me panic....i'm sounding pathetic... i hid behind this wooden fence thing that holds the dumpsters of what i assume is someone lives but it isn't a dorm, anyways i stayed there for a few minutes. calmed down breathed and drank some water. i couldn't see if she passed the meeting point yet but i was like right there but hidden, but it been a while in relevant (is that the word?) to the amount of time it would take to pass the spot. so i got up and turned and started walking back to my dorm.... if i wasn't paying attention i would of ran into her. boom the collision i wanted to avoid is now here and worse! because i hid! did she see i hid?

ot1kwz,waves,"major landmark victory: i no longer believe that social failure = catastrophic humiliation (well, mostly lol). for 6 months ive been working on conquering my social anxiety. i started this journey being horrified of cashiers. i was so desperate for social change in myself that i felt like every cashier interaction that didnt result in a friendship was a failure. i was scared every time i left my room because i thought my roommates were felt i was a weirdo/loser. i would leave some of my social experiments so brutally judging myself for not being able to succeed that i began to feel suicidal. im describing this to show the difference between then and now. well the other day, i went to a social meetup at a bar that was meant for ppl new to my area. i was so scared that i walked around the block twice before entering! i tricked myself into entering by telling myself im just going to get a drink, and after that im leaving. upon entering i was immediately welcomed into a group by some random guy who recognized a shirt i was wearing. i nervously joined, but i did alright. it wasnt catastrophically bad. i even made social mistakes, but they didnt result in some giant humiliation, just a brief moment of heightened self consciousness. i went on just fine for an hour with these guys, and then another couple hours with random other people that were all there to meet ppl. it was beautiful! ppl who were all there with the intention of being nice and socializing. lots of ppl i noticed were a little nervous too, which made me realize that its kinda normal to be nervous! its not just me, and im not just broken. the biggest thing ive learned, however, is that my social anxiety is catastrophic and unrealistic. while i still get waves of embarrassment that hit me in conversations, the amount of time i spend fearing humiliation before/after the situation is so much less. it has happened often enough, and under the microscope that cbt has provided me, that i no longer reinforce the irrational idea that my mistakes will result in a giant humiliating event. the emotional side of my brain is really starting to understand that the risk of mistakes are not super high. it allows me to practice consistently, effectively and deliberately. im not ruining my chances quite as much by just telling myself how its gonna go terribly wrong. because this fear has lessened so much, i was able to walk into that bar and say even if the worst case happens, ill be okay. this is not the same as confidence. during conversation, im still a people-pleasing, not-genuine, over-smiling person who rarely lets my actual personality come to the surface. i cant help it yet. but i more often have moments where i allow myself to act natural, and its because im not so incredibly scared of some huge humiliating event. im chipping away at a belief that adds pressure to situations that shouldnt be scary: that every small social mistake can lead to humiliation! basically im getting better! as much as i havent allowed myself to feel small successes (mostly because the idea of a confident me sounds preposterous and unrealistic), i can no longer deny it! the change is so large and obvious that i no longer believe im stuck in this place. i believe there is a path out of this mess, to a more functional life. and im on that path :). its enough to bring me to tears honestly. im 26 and social anxiety disorder has been lifelong, although i have been high functioning for a good portion of my life. but i just wanna say that change is possible. and cbt has really fast tracked that for me. please keep trying, and please get help. you all can do it! i wanna see this world have more people whove recovered from this horrible disorder, and more role models having an online presence. thanks for reading, i hope this does something to encourage you to keep trying. i love you all!",2,1,1,1,5.5011096e-05,0.99993145,1.3476768e-05

48hd6s,"outside , outside , golf","social anxiety with a girl at university. i am a 20 year old male 1st year student at university who is studying accounting. i am really struggling with making friends. in secondary school it is a lot easier to make friends because there are more group activities so is easy to make friends. in university, this is one of the first times i have been put in a situation to make friends from scratch and have bearly met anyone, at most only a few acquaintances. i feel like i don't relate to anyone. the only thing i have relationship wise is with a girl i met in a seminar at the start of the semester. she is attractive girl and was really warm and nice to me so i was instantly in to her. i've never had a girl like that around me before. after that, we always sat next to each other for that one seminar each week and enjoyed each other's company. as the weeks wait by, each lesson she would be really touchy by playfully punching my arm, leaning into me, putting her head on my shoulder and body language signs that she was into me. i was getting to the point where i would of asked her out around xmas time when for the first time we spent time with each other outside class having a coffee by ourselves and by spending that time with her, i was 99% sure she liked me. the opportunity never arose that day as there wasn't a right moment. after the xmas break, in our seminar class where we sit next to eachother, she started to bring her mates into that class where they'd sit together and i would near her but not next to her. it gave us less opportunity to talk and after a few weeks i was not getting the same energy from her. from her being really into me to barely interested at all. i have tried to be around her friends but it's hard for me to approach her with her friends with my sa and being nervous, shaky, racing heart and having a trembling voice in group situations and i don't want to come across bad so i avoid those types of things like going to the cafe with them etc and that's why i only spent time with her in that one seminar. the thought of me losing my chance with her was killing me inside which made my sa worse with me overthinking every little thing she would say to me and she would be the only thing i would think about all day. i know it's over the top to think like that about someone i spend one lesson with per week but i can't help it with this being the first girl i've genuinely like and who also liked me as well, also being a virgin so i don't want to make a mess of it. i came to the conclusion to try and ask her out after the seminar i sit with her. i asked her quietly ""can we talk to you for a minute after class"". she said okay but when the class was fininshed and she was staying behind, her friends asked ""why are you waiting"" to which she replied ""i need to talk to john(me) for a second"". which really baited out what i was going to do because it only means one thing to talk to someone by themselves which threw me asking her out with her friends around the corner 5 yards away. so i ended up asking her in a really uncomfortable way if she wanted to go to the cinema to which she replied ""i need to clean my house this whole week but definitely another time"". i think this is just a nice way of saying no. it's been a week since this has happened and this has really put me down and overall really dislike what i am like around people because i am a decent person to be around once i am comfortable around people. i've struggled sleeping with me not being able to take that moment out of my head and cringing of the thought of that moment by embarrassing myself and messing up the only chance of having a potential girlfriend and some sort of social interaction. i don't have any friends or social life outside university, only play golf but that is a private hobby so this made the situation worse as i don't have anything to fall back on. i have avoided trying to bump into her because of the awkwardness and the fear of the looks i'll get from her friends with them knowing. can anyone give me any advice on what i should do when i next see her next and their opinion on the whole situation with her, if you think there is any chance because i feel confused on how someone could suddenly lose interest. thanks",2,1,1,1,9.539662e-06,0.99998796,2.5084846e-06
501b5k,paddleboarding,"advice for a very lonely guy[25]. i've looked around for a while on google and reddit for helpful advice, but nothing really matches my situation, so i decided to make a profile and see if you people have any advice. i'm not totally sure what my question is, but maybe you can help anyway. i will italicize parts of this post that are optional, but provide some background info for people who want it. i'm on my phone, so i apologize for any spelling/grammar errors. *me: i'm a 25 year old male. i currently live at home with my parents but will be moving out next month into an apartment by myself. i'm a high school teacher with a good education and supportive, loving family. i'm very introverted (intj for those who like that stuff) and have always been slower at making friends. i don't currently have many. i've been in one, 4 month relationship that ended in june 2015, and that was the last time i had sex. i met her because the was the only single, attractive female that i knew through mutual friends. i, myself, am very average in every way.* i have a hard time making a post like this or complaining because there are so many people in the world who have it so much worse than me, but i'm very, very lonely. i usually spend days off and weekends sitting on the computer. i do have hobbies, but they are not ""social"" hobbies (gym, fishing, skiing, more recently stand-up paddleboarding. [these things can be altered to be ""social,"" but i somehow prevent myself from doing that, and generally like to be left alone while i'm doing them]). i live in the midwest, so there's specific windows when i'm able to do each thing. also, i'm not able to do these every day, or sometimes for a few weeks. my current friends have exactly zero interest in these things. *i've recently come to the realization that my friends are actually pretty terrible to me, and really only use me for their own needs. maybe that's the way friendship always is, but i'm not exactly the most social person ever, so i might be difficult to hang out with. i am always the designated driver (started making them pay), and the butt of jokes because i'm not very respected (possibly for my lack of sports knowledge or experience with girls, the two most important things in life). firing back in my own defense (even jokingly) results in ""you're a douchebag"" or ""you don't need to be mean."" in any case, i didn't come here to complain about them, but i'm just describing why i've decided to hang out with them less and less. unfortunately, i don't have anyone to replace them with.* *my co workers are great people, but most are married or in relationships. i dated a teacher from another department a few times this past year before she lost interest for whatever reason and stopped texting me. they always ask when i'm going to find a girlfriend, but i don't have many opportunities to find one.* i try to accept any party or get-together invitations whenever i get them; i don't get them very often. when i do go, i struggle when talking to people or keeping the conversation flowing, especially with girls. i get into the mindset of, ""this person doesn't care what i'm talking about"" or ""i'm just rambling."" i know, it's a bad mindset to have, but i struggle with it nonetheless. the topics usually go to sports or something, but i just don't have anything to offer in that category. i don't watch much tv, and can't keep up with all of the ""stats"" and shit. a lot of advice i've already read is, ""just go find people you have things in common with."" to me, this is a complete mystery. it's almost like saying, ""stop being sick"" to someone who has a cold and expecting it to help. even if i did find people who shared my hobbies, they are often much better at whatever it is, and they see me as some child who wants to follow along. i get the impression that anything i offer is looked over or seen as me being a ""know it all"" because the conversation quickly turns from there and never goes deep. i check my tone and wording, and i can't figure out what i'm doing wrong. *i have a tinder profile but don't get many matches (1-2 per month) i live near a city, so there's never a shortage of girls, but i have high standards, i think. it seems that most girls who fit my standards are not into me. maybe i'm irrational in my standards: petite/slim/athletic (not chubby or ""curvy""), shorter than me (i'm 6'1""), preferably younger than me, and independent. my motto is ""don't hold anyone to standards you can't hold yourself too,"" but maybe i hold myself to standards that most people don't hold themselves to. in any case, matches i do get fizzle out; i'm not very flirty, sexual, or witty.* when social situations do arise, i find it difficult to engage in the conversation or stay focused. in many cases, i just want to go be alone. but i also crave that social contact and desire for acceptance! i feel like when i'm alone i want to be with people, and when i'm with people, i want to be alone. like i said, i'm not totally sure what my question is. maybe it's ""what am i doing wrong"" or maybe it's ""will you help me make friends."" generally, my biggest statement here is ""help."" despite the fact that i was tearing up through this whole post, i'm a grown ass man and i really shouldn't have to ask, but i just need some kind of guidance here. *tldr: i'm a 25 year old male who is very lonely and struggles talking to people or making connections. please help.*",2,1,1,1,0.00048548845,0.99775356,0.0017609363

(long) step 1. delete instagram. and dont turn back its not worth it, your time is worth more and its definitely not worth looking over peoples pictures and then being depressed after. i myself, used to do this, i would stalk classmates that i never talked to or old friends, people that i used to know and i would be depressed and cry. fuck that. step 2. figure out what you want to do. you need a goal. something to start slow, you cant just jump into something full blast and expect to keep up. so the good thing is you already have some ideas. you said, i dont have hobbies and dont have the social life i want. ok, so this is the part where you will pick/decide on what to do. i would suggest on something easy first and then continue on your journey by adding more things. if you dont have the social skills its going to be a long slump of improving and learning which might be demotivating especially if you have a bad experience. i would suggest getting a small hobby or goal. something you do everyday or whatever schedule you set. having a goal and completing that goal makes you feel fulfilled even if its not that big. maybe something that you can do alone at first, then introduce people later on. ill try to give some suggestions for hobbies. heres some suggestions based on my subreddits: -reading books- r/52book r/bettermentbookclub r/bookclub r/books r/booksuggestions r/suggestmeabook r/whatsthatbook r/freeebooks -exercise- r/bodyweightfitness r/eood (recommended) r/fitness r/flexibility r/gainit r/loseit r/homegym r/running r/c25k r/yoga -meditation- the ios apps headspace &amp; calm are good. r/meditation r/mindfulness r/stoicism (kinda) r/zen r/zenhabits -nutrition- r/1200isplenty r/dryfasting r/fasting r/intermittentfasting r/keto r/mealprepsunday r/nutrition r/supplements r/nootropics r/vegan -misc- r/iwanttolearn r/hobbies r/1dayskill r/getdisciplined r/howtonotgiveafuck (lol) r/learnuselesstalents r/podcasts r/selfimprovement r/wikipedia i could go on for ever, but ill lay it at that. if you still dont have ideas you can pm and i can try to help. now the point is theres unlimited things in this world that you can do, from boxing to knitting to learning about cats to learning about murder mysteries. the problem is procrastination and not knowing what to do or how to start. step 3. getting started. ok so lets say you picked reading as your hobby. dont expect your going to start reading everyday or even every other day. go get a book, something interesting maybe the harry potter series. go to this subreddit r/thexeffect and make a schedule on whatever youre doing. maybe you can try read 10 minutes a day or 20 minutes every other day. you could also just read 1 time a week and not specify the minutes. whatever you choose. just make it slow and doable. this sub has helped me brush my teeth everyday, i was real depressed and i stayed in bed all day, and didnt have the greatest of hygiene. it was fixed with time. and boom! you completed something and now you feel better about yourself :) i would suggest posting on their for motivation or get an accountability partner if you need it. you can do anything you want to if you put your mind to it. also, if you need anymore resources google is your friend &amp; youtube videos/tutorials. step 4. go out and live your life! theres so many interesting things to learn and people to meet. just remember to start slow and work 1 day at a time. the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. the second best time is now - chinese proverb",2,1,1,0,0.9999819,1.4252205e-05,3.81699e-06
qzlpyt, walk,"what does it mean when i'm too shy to ask my coworkers to take me home?. so i have a problem with buses around my workplace, and i was supposed to go home a few times pretty late but it meant i should wait an hour for the bus to arrive. a few of those times i decided i won't wait and walked for 20 minutes on foot in a dangerous path near the road where cars drive literally a few centimeters away from my body to get to another bus station, because i really needed to get home. the thought of asking someone to take me there never occurred to me(even though it's just a 2 minute ride). i honestly just gave excuses to myself as for why i shouldn't ask anyone. because they are busy at work/because there's no one that can take me. i had absolutely no idea i could ask someone to take me there and go back to the workplace, and frankly i didn't even try, i just assumed nobody can. even at times when we have to decide for 1 person to stay, i always feel guilty and selfish when i go home instead of someone else, although i do haves stuff to do at evening. i used to agree to stay but it meant i'd have to do this dangerous 20 minute walk to get to the bus station. i honestly hate that i do this, i make myself so small compared to other people that i'd rather suffer than ask someone to take just 4 minutes of their time to drive me somewhere. i was wondering why i had this fear. maybe i was afraid of bothering them, or of them disliking me because of it, as irrational as i know it is. the fact that i'm a people pleaser really puts me at a tough spot and i hate being like this, i feel so submissive and quiet when i'm really not just because i'm afraid of bothering someone else/angering them/making them dislike me. i can't even confront people face to face, and in the rare occasions i try(usually it's with someone i'm comfortable with), i do it with zero confidence and i prepare to apologize once they react badly. i even have a hard time speaking clearly in front of people i'm uncomfortable around because i don't want to burden them and they end up not hearing me sometimes. i cant pretend it doesn't bother me when someone else is disappointed or disturbed by a decision that i have made, even if i try to take a risk and do it or ask for help. does anyone have tips for how i can overcome people pleasing? how can i overcome being too shy to ask people for help?",2,1,1,2,8.452327e-05,0.111960575,0.88795483

child i was always considered a shy boy. i didn't speak much when in a group. this made my family and relatives think i was an introvert and didn't have a lot friends (which honestly weirded me out a bit as i was often asked ""you don't have a lot of friends, do you?"" or ""how many friends do you have?""). however, in school, i always felt i was a different person somewhat. i did actually have friends. not as many as someone not anxious or not shy, but i always put myself around my friends when in school. so anyway, fast forward a few years to the last year in my school, i finally started talking with girls of my class. so by now you may have figured i was less shy than before. but still a lot shy. around this time you would expect a guy to hang out with his friends all the time. *i believe i low key always wanted that.* however, i lived some 6 miles from my school and i had no bicycle or motor vehicle to travel that far every day (as most of my school friends lived near the school). so i ended up staying at home all day and playing video games. with girls (and now women), i had it worse. till about my 11th grade, i didnt speak to a lot of girls. barely if any. in my 11th grade, i started making a few girl friends but i never talked to them as much as my guy friends. we hung out like once or twice but once school was over i couldnt meet them as often and didn't text them a lot either. moving on to relationships, the first true crush i had was in 7th grade i believe. she lived close to me and went to school in the same bus. i first texted her on social media and we got to talking. i believe we became ""social media"" friends but i never really talked to her in person because i was afraid of i dont know what. she eventually left my school and i never really got to talk to her again. the second crush i had was the time i started approaching girls. i still didnt talk as much as a normal guy would but i met this girl in my class. we sat next to each other waiting for our class to begin. 15 minutes of silence later i asked for the time or something. we started talking and moved on to texting. this time i spoke in person more than last time (but again, not as much as a normal person would). we became really good friends. she suddenly disappeared so that was over. **this was my school life** now comes my recent university life. i was more outgoing now that i had to stay in my university for atleast 8 hours a day. my life was definitely happier (since surprise, i am actually an extrovert). i was still a bit shy but i no longer was scared of casual group gatherings. in fact, i enjoyed those. life still sucked past 5 pm because i still did not have a mode of transport to travel 8 miles everyday. but it was better than before. here i met my third crush. she is an introvert and had an attitude. i could now talk to women better (again, not as good as a normal guy) but something about her made me very nervous. i tried talking to her for 2 years, couldn't. in my 3rd year was when i started talking to her properly. but she never showed interest in knowing me so i eventually lost interest in her and generally avoid her. and this was my history of my anxiety. i finished my 4 years in the university yesterday. about six months ago i was at my absolute worst. i still couldnt hang out with my friends after 5 pm. i had to stay home after that and i started getting depressed and had negative thoughts. anxiety peaked. thats when my father said something to my younger sister, you and your mother are the only extroverts in our house. something did not feel right. i knew the actual meaning of both the terms, and i didnt feel like an introvert that my father labelled me. i soon learned that i am actually an extrovert, but i had social anxiety. thats when i first came across the term. realising that i had social anxiety helped me a lot to fight it. i suddenly had my anxiety decreased a lot. i now make friends very easily. i have made more friends in the past 6 months than i had made in the past 4 years. obviously, in situations i realised that my fears were irrational. however, i haven't been completely been able to overcome it. i will give some instances. &gt;**1** i am still not great at talking with women. i have always felt that i am a sub-human. i think that i am not good looking (even though i have been told otherwise), i will bore them if i talk to them which means i can't make the first move ever, or that something about me will repel any potential dates i could have. &gt;**2** my family has been broke for the past 4 years. my (fairly) large friend circle asks me to hang out. one friend circle spends a lot of money so i haven't hanged out with them in about 2-3 years. i feel bad about it but for some reason i can't tell them that i am broke as fuck. i can't afford to go to a restaurant or coffee place every other day and have some a grade shit. they feel that i don't think them as friends anymore. and my anxiety makes me feel really bad about it. &gt;**3** sometimes i feel truly confident. very confident in fact. in that state sometimes i get the job done whatever it may be, but sometimes when the work actually comes, i panic and stop myself from doing the work or avoid the public gathering. i realise that my fear is irrational but it just consumes me. &gt;**4** sports. as i said, anxiety and shyness are truly fucking terrible. i never was able to play sports for long because i felt i sucked and everyone hated me for that. today as i am less anxious and more interested in sports, i feel like playing a soccer, but most of my friends have been playing (with people) for several years and they are atleast good at it. i know i can't keep up with them and honestly it doesnt matter because at this age, they aren't going to make it to the international leagues either. but for some reason, i fear being judged still. &gt;**5** i made a few girl friends over the years now but i still can't talk to them as much because i feel i will be boring to them. my anxiety ruins my friendships with them. one of the main reason why i truly want to get over my anxiety. when i talk to them i realise that these girls consider me a friend, but i can't just speak with them properly and maintain that friendship. in january, i plan on started mma classes since i learned that physical fitness and exercise helps in you confidence, a lot. but i want some other advises that can make me get over my anxiety completely. my life would be so much better if i do, so please help. thank you",2,1,1,1,9.18298e-06,0.9999857,5.0791446e-06

b1wlb8,"Outside , outside , bicycle","i don't know how to approach this... so, this is a bit complicated.i'm a 19 y/o guy studying at university at the moment. this is my third year in uni, 2nd in my current study programme (i quit my first study on a different uni). i haven't really made any real friendships/connections from uni, although i often work with one person i can get along with very well. outside of studying we don't really do anything outside of uni.in the first year at the other uni, i didn't have any friends except my cousin with whom i often play games via discord and formerly teamspeak. when i was in high school, i didn't have any friends. i tried to connect with other people, but i was too anxious. the 6 years i was in high school was definitely the worst time of my life. especially in the lunch breaks i felt horrible, i often went home on my bicycle, even though it took up a large part of the break time. i did this because i did't know where to sit (our school was horribly crowded in the breaks, there weren't even enough tables). i also feared sitting with my classmates, this fear grew stronger in the later years. back to my cousin, he plays an important role in my current social life. he was in a different high school, and i was 2 years ahead of him. around 2014-15 we started gaming via teamspeak, which was a big relief for me, as i didn't have any other way to socialize with people. after a while, a few classmates of his also joined, and ever since we still talk via discord all the time. currently it's my cousin, my brother (he was 2 grades lower at my high school, i will explain his role in the story below) and two friends of my cousin (classmates) which are in discord all the time, and we are basically friends. when i quit my first year on uni halfway through, i started working at a supermarket for a while before starting my next study. while working there, i saw my cousin's classmates for the first time, which was a bit awkward, but nothing too bad. it was nice seeing them irl for the first time. now my brother. he is 1 year younger than me, and was 2 grades below me. he did have some friends, but one best friend which he still is. since around 2016, when i was in my last year, he went to the disco/club (not sure what to call it, it's basically an empty hall packed with people where dance/big room house is played by a dj) with my cousin and some other friends, and he quickly made friends with those people (including the teamspeak/discord group). i forgot the order in which the connections grew, but it's not that important. back to today, what it comes down to is that my brother, his friend, and the friend group of my cousin (and kinda me, limited to discord) became one big friend group. for like 2 years now, they go the the club almost every saturday or friday night. and i? i never went to a club even once. i'm too socially anxious. in the beginning i was not interested in night-life, however, after a while i regret never going. it would have been a great way to get to know the friend group better.i feel like i'm too late at this point in time. every time they go out, they send video's and pictures on our snapchat group chat, and it makes me feel sick in the stomach to see them having fun, while i'm at home doing nothing. aside from going to the club, they do a lot more fun things together like going on a vacation to spain, and this year to albufeira, or going to birthday parties or other random parties from people i don't even know. i feel horrible to be disconnected from those events, and the fact that they have many more friends than me. the problem i have is that i don't how to get involved in those social activities. i'm extremely anxious to go to the club with them, especially because they have done it a myriad of times, while i have never been to the club. a few times my cousin has asked me to join, but i said no because i was too anxious. i instantly regret it, but didn't do anything about it. after all this time i fear to go with them, i don't how to behave at the club, and them having all this 'experience' makes it even worse.the fact that my brother is involved in all these social events makes it extra hard for me, it makes me feel like an outcast. i've always portrayed myself to my brother as someone who doesn't like parties and that kind of stuff. i feel like i need to break this image of myself from my brother and my cousin. i feel like it would've been a lot easier if my brother wasn't involved in this group of friends. i would greatly appreciate if someone can help me break the status quo and get more connected with my friends. the greatest fear that i need to break is going to the club with them, which feels like a massive threshold.maybe someone has been through something similar, and can share his or her experience.",2,1,1,1,1.3150674e-05,0.9999609,2.596984e-05
57jul7,"benches, outside ","i just got back from my first date ever.. i am 20 years old and male. like many of you my social anxiety has made me shy away from women and dating. a couple months ago i met a girl a couple years older than me that works at my mom's workplace. for a long time i didn't reach out to her out of fear of the outcome, as well as self destructive thoughts: ""she's too good for me"" ""it's been too long. it would be wierd now"". i got myself into a better place mentally and finally realized i have nothing to lose by trying. i texted her saying i would like to get to know her better and i asked if she wanted to get coffee with me. she agreed and we planned a time. getting that message saying she did want to go out with me made me the happiest i have felt in awhile. it was almost like a drug. i read the message and a wave of happiness washed over me and suddenly i got the motivation to just do something. so i did some exercising which i have a lot of trouble making myself do. a few days later she told me she was going to meet a (female) friend afterward to eat and asked if i wanted to join them after the two of us got coffee. i agreed. initally i was really excited, but as the day approached that excitement was replaced with anxiety. about 30 minutes before my stomach was in knots. on the drive there i was doing deep breathing exercises to keep myself from freaking out. i was early so i was in my car repeating to myself: ""you can do this"" ""she is just a regular person"" ""she is going to be nervous too"" then i saw her walk into the coffee shop. ""this is it"" i told myself. i got out and walked in. i saw her and we said hello and exchanged pleasantries. we ordered and she said she would pay for herself. i said i was happy to get it for her, but i did not insist and i let her pay for herself. we walked out to the benches outside and talked for awhile. i had done lots of research on first date conversation to prepare myself. we talked about her job, our pets and my job. we both went to the same university, but at different times. we both dropped out. that created quite a bit of conversation topics. we even got off on a political discussion somehow. this actually worked out well since we have similar views on the subject. afterward we walked to the restaurant which was just down the road and met her friend. it was actually really nice having her friend there. it took some of the pressure off me to keep conversation going. again we all paid for our own food, but i did offer to take care of the appetizer we all shared and i did. once the night was over her friend left and just me and her walked together until we got to my car. we said goodnight and she said she would like to see more of me. i said i wanted to see her again as well and we went our separate ways. i feel so accomplished. i kicked my anxiety in the nads and did something that makes even a normal person nervous. sure i was a little quiet and i didn't say a whole whole lot about myself. still i'm glad i got the chance to get to know her and to my suprise i actually had quite a bit of fun.",2,1,1,1,0.000104138344,0.9998865,9.284564e-06

eacyld8,outside,"i feel you, it could've been me writing this story. they say that our anxiety causes up to make stupid decisions but i had a similar situation to yours and took the alternate route. i was around 14 at the time. my mum dropped me off at the bank to do a transaction that takes about half an hour to process while she went to the supermarket next door to shop. it took about an hour to get to a teller and finish the transaction then i called my mum to let her know i was finished. she wouldn't answer. it was raining outside so i just decided to sit back down in the waiting area figuring she would call me when she's ready. over the next hour, the waiting area clears and the tellers keep glancing at me probably wondering why i was loitering. i lean back and doze off. i feel a tap on my leg and open my eyes to see a manager and security guard in front of me. the manager asks if i need help with something and i say no that i'm just waiting on my mum to pick me up. she gives me an odd look and says okay and nods to the security guard. i check my phone and realise i've been sleeping for 30 minutes. before i can decide what i'm going to do i get a call. it's my dad. he sounds angry and asks where i am. i tell him i'm in the bank waiting for mum to come back for me. he then tells me that someone in the bank called and told him that i was there sleeping in the waiting area well after i had finished my business with the bank. he said i looked like an idiot just sitting there. after he hangs up, i look around and see the tellers and security guards staring at me again; they probably heard my conversation. i pack up and go outside and stand behind a column so no one in the bank could see me waiting. about 20 minutes later my mum pulls up and i get in the car. she asks how long i've been waiting and then why i hadn't just gone to the supermarket when i finished. i don't know. i was so embarrassed by the whole situation. i never went back to that branch but after it closed, some of the staff were moved to the other branch i used in order to avoid ever seeing those people again. it'd be another hour to find the next closest branch so i've been stuck seeing these people since.",2,1,1,1,4.4776543e-06,0.99993587,5.9602844e-05

(and how things got a lot better) as far as i can look back, i always dreaded groups of people. i could talk with people one on one when i knew them and the topic was in my interest, but how bigger the group the more i disappeared in the background and starting to feel lonely. i had some things i was happy about but i had a problem, a huge problem and i didnt know how to solve it. even though it seemed like my life was doing well. i was terrible at socializing with new people and started to go down the hill i always thought things like: is there something wrong with me why is everybody having a good time and im standing here alone? im not interesting i want to participate but i dont know what to say so many people and still i felt alone. like did it even matter why i was here in the first place? no one seems to care about my presence. and the cluttering noise of all those voices, what if they just dont like me and are just ignoring me, secretly hoping that i would leave on my own? i could not understand why i was not able to make a conversation with anyone. i could try to talk to someone i didnt know but, i was too scared to do that, my heart rate would go up, my head turned red, knees shaking and my hands wear sweating. im not giving someone a hand with that warm sticky hands that would be weird right? damn, how could i ever gain the confidence to talk to someone at work, it was no different, when i had a meeting with co-workers. my mind would race all the time but when i had to say something i would just stay quiet. i still remember the day that i got promoted around christmas and my boss told me i should do a speech in front of everybody unprepared. i didnt want to do it but i couldnt say no either. most awkard moment of my life almost panicking in front of my co-workers those were the struggles and thoughts i had almost every day. of course, i tried to overcome my fear and starting to talk to someone. it felt so awkward... that conversation died really fast and made me feel like a total failure. my mind went blank and didnt know what to say i thought that i might be disturbing that person his privacy. frustrated and confused i go home, i went on the internet to look for some guidance on how to talk to people/socializing. i got angry every time i saw those mainstream videos on youtube where the person in the video clearly hasnt figured it out himself. just be confident or just be yourself they say. like really f\*cking smart einstein, look where that just be yourself bs has brought me at this point. and even worse it looks like everyone else already has it figured out. no else seems to have this problem i thought the only way to be cool and accepted by others, was to be someone else instead of embarrassing the person i really was. i already had tried some confidence/dating courses on the internet for a lot of moneya psychologist that gave me wrong diagnose, therapists that didnt understand me, psychiatrists that gave meds like they where some candy, stupid apps that didnt work and on social media i havent any success so far. all i wanted was that someone came along to help me out of that jungle of frustration and confusion and help me to become the coolest person in the room. i wanted to be funny and interesting at the same time. i wanted to be that person that people like to hang out with. i wanted to become more outgoing and easily make friends. i wanted to lose the fear of getting judged and self-doubt. i didnt want to care anymore what people thought about me. now after almost 5 years of hustling hard getting myself out of my comfort zone and working hard on myself. i overcame my social anxiety, have no trouble talking in front of a large group of people, i can engage in conversations with more people included than just 1, i can speak in an assertive way without starting to freak out. i am making a career and had several girlfriends that were beautiful and interesting that i never thought would be in my league. all i did was improving step by step my social skills. now what i want to do is help people in their 20s and 30s with social anxiety, that can resonate with my story. and if you read until here, the chances are really high that you have been going through the same. tell me about your experiences! im really curious to hear about it! in the comments or just send me a private message!",0,0,0,0,0.99998975,1.0259218e-05

dsc4ez3,"riding , run ","i was like this when i first started driving too!! like you, my dad ""taught"" me how to drive. he basically didn't teach me anything or explain any driving rules, but would scream at me at the top of his lungs when i wasn't even doing anything wrong. my mom never drove with me and when she did she'd basically be having a panic attack, so she was useless too. when i finally got my license at age 18, i practically had no driving experience. now i'm almost 21, and i still get nervous about driving, but i no longer cry or freak out. i also think my bad driving has improved over the years. here are some things i've learned that help: 1) stop caring about what other drivers think!!! obviously, you shouldn't drive recklessly, but for me stressing over messing up and about other drivers judging me actually led to me driving poorly. practice driving at night in low traffic areas to build your confidence. don't worry about other drivers judging you for making small mistakes or driving too slow, because tons of people are awful drivers and drive recklessly on purpose. also something i used to do was obsessively stare at the person behind me in my rearview because i was worried about anyone riding my ass. if you do this too, try to stop because it's really distracting! 2) slow down i know you didn't mention this, but i used to have an issue where i would brake too late/turn too fast because again i was worried about the person behind me. you will be a better driver if you slow down and drive carefully, instead of speeding when you're already uncomfortable with driving. 3) play relaxing music i find it really helps me if i have music i like on to distract me from any panicked thoughts. 4) remember everyone makes driving mistakes humans aren't perfect, and that's the reason car accidents happen. don't beat yourself up over it, just remind yourself to learn from your mistakes. people run red lights, turn when they're not supposed to, cut people off, etc. just try to pay attention to traffic lights and double check whenever you are turning or changing lanes. 5) observe others i find it really helpful to closely watch someone who is driving me around (if they're a good driver.) i just observe their driving techniques and think about how said person drives the next time i drive myself. this sounds kind of weird, but it does help me. it also helped me to read online about driving tips for new drivers. 6) get more sleep and don't drive if you are overtired or extremely stressed i don't know if this applies to you, but if i don't sleep enough i drive terribly. i start to make careless and stupid mistakes. for example, while sleep deprived i have backed into a parking ramp pole, went over curbs while turning, and even rear ended someone because i was looking behind me (trying to get onto thruway while at a yield sign) and forgot to look in front of me. i hope i helped a little bit, and please don't beat yourself up over making a mistake!",0,0,0,1,0.00022820535,0.9997718

6cu47k,"riding,  waves,  waves","ups and downs are part of the process. people often tell me that in their battle with social anxiety, one day they will go out and score a major victory, such as asking a girl they like for her number, raising their hand and speaking up in a staff meeting or even going out of the house where they felt unable to before. but then they often find the next day or some time later, they feel unable to do something, which had felt quite comfortable for them before. they feel deflated, defeated and often despondent. in my own experience, i remember i would feel like i was riding high on the crest of a wave of confidence often for days, weeks or even months at a time. then i would seem to suddenly come crashing down face first onto a pile of rocks as i had an anxiety attack, public breakdown or some other kind of agonising setback. it was years of these constant ups and downs that (without wishing to be melodramatic or depressive) even led me to contemplate suicide. not out of some grandiose kurt cobain-style, shotgun-to-the-head, fuck you! to the world, but more out of seeking a simple, quiet escape from the sheer mental and physical exhaustion of high, followed by breakdown, followed by building myself back up from the ground up, followed by public breakdown. by the way, it should be noted here that what i mean by public breakdown is written from my perspective at the time. they seemed very public and very crushing at the time, but externally appeared only as my face turning slightly pale and me losing my composure a little. i know this because one such episode happened while i was being filmed for a class as part of my masters degree. i was actually amazed to see how little of my episode was objectively apparent. there is nothing from the video footage to suggest the almost uncontrollable pounding of my heart, the tunnel vision, the total mind blank, dizziness and giddying, almost surreal self consciousness i felt internally. this footage actually became a useful reminder and technique for dealing with social anxiety and anxiety attacks, as it showed me how unnoticeable the effects are externally to other people. when we are having such an attack, we almost believe that it is becoming a public spectacle and everyone can see exactly what is going on. but as with so much of social anxiety, most people have no inclination of the trouble we are going through and are much too preoccupied with themselves to worry about (what we believe is) us humiliating ourselves. it was as i drove home from my episode, with my head still ringing and my body racked from the influx of enough cortisol, adrenaline and norepinephrine to resuscitate an elephant from a coma, that i thought to myself, i honestly dont know how much longer i can take this. when i got home, i was so physically and mentally drained that i had to go to bed for the rest of the day. i later learned that it takes the body weeks to fully recover from an anxiety attack. but that is just an example of one of the low points that punctuated periods of real high. at times i felt happy and confident and considered stopping seeing my therapist because i was sure i had got this social anxiety thing beaten. i was making progress with my therapist by talking and trying to discover and address the root causes of my feelings of shame and low self-worth which underpin all social anxiety. but it wasnt until i started to take other positive actions (as outlined in my previous post), that i was able to extend the lengths of my waves of confidence and then break free of the cycle of highs and lows altogether. if you are still going through the cycle, i know how physically and mentally exhausting it can be. but you should remember that this is a normal part of the battle against this limiting condition. however, its not enough to let yourself be passively tossed about on the peaks and troughs of these waves, believing that things will get better over time or by themselves. you have to take responsibility for overcoming social anxiety and take massive action. with a combination of changing your physical world through exercise and positive habits as well as rewiring your inner world through therapy and belief pattern change, there is a way out of the maze. dont get disheartened or despondent because of your setbacks and dont forget to celebrate your victories, no matter how seemingly small or insignificant. and most importantly, keep fighting.",0,0,0,0,0.9999987,1.274533e-06

82fqdc,sea,"find your purpose to help beat sad. oftentimes social anxiety can be part of a wider malaise of lack of direction in life, depression, general sense of inertia, and low self-esteem. i found that having clear goals and a sense of purpose is part of the kind of positive lifestyle that can help to overcome social anxiety. # importance of goals and purpose## with goals and purpose, we are more invested in our own life, have something to get out of bed for in the morning. we generally feel more confident and positive in ourselves, and are less easily affected by social anxiety relapses and setbacks (which inevitably come). when we are focused on a positive goal or a wider sense of purpose, we also have less room in our mind for the kind of habitual negative rumination which are the fetid breeding ground for social anxiety. social anxiety often makes us feel helpless and can lead to serious depression. maxwell maltz, personal development legend and author of psycho-cybernetics said: 'the individual who is actively engaged in a struggle or a in a striving toward an important goal, does not come up with pessimistic philosophies concerning the meaningless or the futility of life'. the popular author and blogger mark manson also noted that, if you are busy giving a f*ck about things that really matter to you (like your goals and greater purpose in life) you give much less of a f*ck about other stuff. for social anxiety sufferers, that 'other stuff' usually includes things like the awkward interaction you just had with the cashier in the supermarket. or the weird goodbye you had with that casual acquaintance you really wished you hadnt bumped into. the point here being that if you can identify some big goals to work on and strive towards a greater purpose for your life, then it gives a different perspective on life. negative thought patterns are squeezed out or sidelined by the size of your grand vision for your life. things that would normal bother us shrink in significance. #'s your ikigai?## no, 'ikigai' is not those rice balls with sea urchin on top. it's basically' a reason to get out of bed in the morning'. a 'reason to enjoy life'. the japanese say that everyone has an ikigai. and i'm inclined to agree with them. the problem is that when we're struggling with social anxiety and the associated depression, we can often lose site of our ikigai. or we may not have even had one in the first place. i know when i was in a very bad place with social anxiety i had no goals or purpose. i had no goddam ikigai! it was finding my sense of purpose that helped get me out of my social anxiety pit and that led me to writing this post today. at the centre of the ikigai diagram is where your ikigai and purpose in life lies. sometimes your ikigai may be unconventional, as it was in my case. and in the case of my brother (he's a dog whisperer in cambodia!). but it doesn't matter. the main thing is to discover a sense of purpose in life that gives it meaning. you should also not be afraid to 'make your mess your message'. for example, instead of trying to deny my social anxiety i have made it my lifes work and it is what gives my life meaning and purpose. ### i'm a very firm believer in identifying your purpose in life and setting goals around that. it has helped me massively in overcoming social anxiety and turned me from a depressed pessimist into a very positive person with great passion for life. when you do this and are able to do work that you truly love, you can 'tap dance to work' as warren buffett describes it. when this happens, there is less room in your life for socially anxious thoughts. so, if you havent done so, try the ikigai diagram or any other of the hundreds of articles and youtube clips on the internet. i'm not saying they will 'cure' your social anxiety, but they may help lay a more positive foundation for your life. these might help you to start living a life of passion and purpose where there is less room for low self-esteem, over-thinking and social anxiety.",0,0,0,0,0.99999094,9.0098265e-06
9nzd45,runner,"this 1 word changed my life. over the 25 years that i suffered with social anxiety, i developed something i call the no reflex. by learning to break it with one simple word, i was able to change my life and help my recovery from social anxiety disorder. &amp;; # the no reflex &amp;; i wouldnt mind wagering that you have a no reflex too. its where someone invites you to leaving drinks/a birthday party/a get-together of some kind and your immediate reflex is no. more often than not you wont say this out loud. you go along with it to the persons face, to be politeyeah, sure. im not sure what im doing on saturday, but ill definitely try and come. as you say this, youre already thinking what excuse youll use on the day, when youll message them at the last minute to say you cant go. for me, it wasnt as if i even fully considered what the invitation was. it was as if there was a circuit in my brain: as soon as i heard anything that sounded like an invitation my mind would shut down. i would already be thinking no!...hell no...i can ***not*** do that. then later in life i wondered why i would spend my friday and saturday evenings alone, drinking by myself watching youtube. it turns out, that if you turn down enough invitations, you soon stop getting invited to stuff at all. &amp;; # just say yes! &amp;; when i was living as an expat in china, there came a point where i couldnt handle another weekend on my own. i had basically been living as a hermit in my apartment. i was becoming more and more withdrawn and even leaving the apartment was causing me panic attacks and a huge amount of distress. one week a friend-of-a-friend was leaving to go back to the us and, unexpectedly, i was invited to their leaving dinner at a local restaurant. despite every fibre in my body wanting to say no, i accepted out of sheer desperation and loneliness. as the saturday night of the dinner party approached, i started concocting all the usual excuses: sorry, im really not feeling well ... something just came up and im not going to able to make it etc etc but this time i didnt back out. of course, my social anxiety wasnt going to make it easy on me. my mind started imagining all the possible nightmare scenarios that could occur i imagined a huge table of impossibly glamorous and beautiful people all sitting around laughing and having fun... then i walk in. everything stops. and everyone looks at me in disgust. i have a meltdown in front of everyone and humiliate myself. &amp;; # its almost never as bad as you imagine &amp;; when the evening came and i arrived at the restaurant, i thought my worst fears had been realised. i arrived at the restaurant late. when i heard the guests had already gone to a private room and started dinner, i thought about doing a runner. but i rode out my impulse to escape. the waiter showed me to a private room. i was already extremely nervous and sweating. as he opened the door, i saw a room with a huge round table with about 20 people sat around it. my heart doubled its pounding. there was some awkward shuffling as it turned out there wasnt a chair or a spare place for me. i started to cringe and squirm inside. im such a burden ... ive crashed this party and im making life difficult for them. but this uncomfortable moment passed and i was found a place and a seat. and once id hastily downed a couple of drinks and said hello to the one or two people that i knew there, i started to settle down. as the alcohol and conversation started to flow, i found i was actually having a really good time. by the time we finished dinner, everyone was pretty merry. it was then decided that wed all go to a bar and continue drinking. &amp;; # one thing leads to another # the upshot was that i pushed myself to go to something and ended up having a really good time. i met a number of new people there, and i started to get invited to get-togethers by them too. i was initially terrified of each thing i was invited to. and (im not going to lie) i was still using a fair amount of alcohol to get through them at first. but i was becoming less and less anxious the more i exposed myself to these occasions. the most amazing thing to me was that one dinner party opened up a whole web of connections. i went from drinking by myself in my apartment in front of my laptop every weekend to being plugged into a large network of people. this meant that i was being invited to midweek poker, weekend bowling, leaving drinks, birthday parties. now i know this might sound like hell to you right now, but ill bet theres also a part of you that wants nothing more than human connection and some social interaction. this is the strange paradox of social anxiety: being terrified of the thing that we want (and actually need) the most. **we often avoid social situations, while sitting shut up in our apartments dying of loneliness and craving human connection.** this can be especially painful and confusing if youre a socially anxious extrovert like i was. &amp;; # something good almost always comes out of it # now im not saying that if you accept an invitation youll be opened up to a whole new network of connections as i was. but...one thing ive learned from many years of saying yes is that at least one good thing almost *always* comes out of it. its so easy for us to rationalise turning down an invitation. it comes so easily to us to make excuses of why we cant go to something. **the no reflex becomes habitual and ingrained.** but when you break it, say yes and go to an event, something positive and often life-changing happens. whether it be an art show you wanted to see, a meet-up with a friend, a work conference - it doesnt matter. in 2017 i went to a conference in san diego and despite initial reservations, i made two connections there that changed my life. one of them led to trips to mexico, spain, costa rica, hong kong and thailand with the person i met there who became a close friend. i was 36 years old at the time. which also goes to show (despite what you may believe right now) its always possible to make new connections, regardless of how old you are and how bad your sad has been. &amp;; # conclusion # my message is simple (though not necessarily easy): just say yes! break the no reflex. if an opportunity arises to participate in something, grab it! **you will not get better by sitting in your apartment.** yes, its scary and painful at first, but it gets easier as you expose yourself to social situations. your cognitive distortions and catastropshizing thoughts will fuck with you. your mind will conjure up all kinds of nightmare scenarios. thats ok. its a normal part of sad. they are just thoughts. acknowledge them as the trolls they are and let them move on. dont feed them by engaging with them. because imagination is usually very exaggerated, reality will rarely (if ever) be as bad or good as you imagine. therefore, catastrophization rarely comes to fruition. and there is almost always a big and potentially life-changing pay off if you do take the risk. and, trust me, the short-term pain of getting out of your comfort zone is far less than the long-term misery of staying isolated and lonely. so, next time an opportunity presents itself, say yes!. and even if it doesnt present itself, create an opportunity by signing up for a meet-up/joining something/inviting someone you know to something you want to do. my experience, and the experience of my coaching clients, tells me it will be worth it.",0,0,0,0,0.99999595,4.095316e-06

dx88y3p,"golf, outside ","hi! :\) i have also posted on this sub reddit (and then deleted them out of fear of being judged, go figure), crying in the process. people without social anxiety will never know how isolating and horrible it can be. i feel your pain. my best advice from personal experience, as scary and intimidating as it seems, is to get a job that makes you interact with people. last summer i became a bartender at a golf course. i was absolutely terrified, and was totally awkward and shy the first couple of weeks. slowly but surely the forced social interaction seriously made me less self\-conscious, more confident, and better at social interaction. now, i am a young 20\-something\-year\-old girl serving mostly middle aged men as customers \- this kind of made it easier for me to build my confidence, because let's be honest, it's easy to impress/infatuate middle aged tipsy guys when you're a younger girl. but \- even outside of becoming much more confident \(within even just 1 month\) at my job around these older guys, i started becoming much more confident around people my age. i actually went on multiple dates with a few different guys last summer, and i had never been on a date before then! unfortunately due to school starting back up in the fall and other personal demands i had to stop working. since stopping, my social anxiety has crept back up \- leading me to face the fact that battling social anxiety is an ongoing uphill battle that you need to routinely fight \(but you can absolutely do it\). fortunately, i'm starting bartending again this weekend. i'm terrified but also excited at the prospect of getting my social anxiety under control again. moral of the story \- push yourself, no matter how scary it seems. i know it sounds like such a cliche, and i hate hearing that the way to help/cure your anxiety is to get out of your comfort zone because it seems so fucking daunting and impossible, but please believe me when i tell you it helps/works! and you can do it if i can do it. trust me. please please please dm me if you want. i have more to say but just wanted to make this as short as possible :\)",0,0,0,0,0.9999974,2.6158696e-06
g7tdimc,cabin,"wtf i had to read this twice i thought it was my post, everything u said in your post resonates with me even down to the not feeling able to finish your degree. i finished my law degree a year ago, i got a 2:1. u can finish yours too, i promise you that. i nearly got kicked out in 2nd year when i failed a module because i didnt show for 2 exams (because i went home mentally ill on the uni counsellors advice, but didnt get a referral because i didnt get a doctors letter i needed as proof, but that was because the doctor wouldnt see me but gave me a anti depressants prescription without a diagnosis). i wasnt showing up for class because i wasnt taking in any of it, and i fell behind. this basically happened on all my modules though only this one i got extra fucked on. my assignments were due either every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks, my attendance was poor and when i did attend i basically had no idea what was going on. when lecturers asked me questions i was never able to answer, i cant hear and process long-winded questions at all, then think of an answer, and then say the answer, i jsut cant fucking do it it seems. same problem for long-winded written exam questions. im slow at understanding the questions, slow at thinking of an answer, and slow at putting it in words. i have to read questions and sentences over and over to like, process the words and then comprehend there meaning. its fucked. i've been like this since school, atleast age 15, because i remember having a test for dyslexia back then, i never went back to ask for the results but id assume theyd have contacted me if i did have it (the test was done at school with the school counsellor woman). back at gcse which is like age 15 and 16, id bury my head in the sand by playing games. it was an escape. not because i was lazy as my mum still tells me i was now, but i couldnt do the work, i would take ages reading a single page, and none of it was going in and it would seriously infuriate me, i broke stuff because of it, smashed my laptop (which all my revsion was on, so a significant factor in why i did bad at school at 15 probably). people would give me revision techniques and none of them helped, but apparently i was just lazy. so how did i finish my uni degree? well basically the assignments were written starting about 2 days before hand in. even though i always had 2 or 3 weeks to do them. i couldnt concentrate until literally the fear of failure forced me to do it and i did i sweating in a state of panick. fuelled with red bull, and listening to airplane cabin white noise on youtube (it's the only way i can drown out the racing thoughts of my mind, and without the emotional stimualtion of music) and sad to say, post nut clarity. when i get stressed like that i guess the only way to destress and clear the mind is... you get the idea. my last assignment i had to do a moot court (basically a mock court hearing) and i had to take friggin propranolol so i could speak and stop my mind going blank (which always happens to me.) sooo i do wonder if i have adhd or add, ive never been to hyper, my brain is always in 7th gear, racing thoughts, but thats not seen in my personality really (apart from when i used to bite everyone when i was like 3) so i'd guess add, also wonder about auditory processing disorder. i also dont know if this came first or the anxiety and depression. i feel like i started to hideaway and became more introverted due to not being able to get my work done from the learning issues and as i said games became an escape. very interesting hearing how similar your story is, let us know how u get on. see i wanted a military engineering career but i couldnt get that with a diagnosis. on the other hand i dont feel like i could do the job because of these problems. i havent seemed to be able to find a fix to this issue in the last few years, no amount of excersize or eating better or drinking water, vitamin tablets, cbd, nothing seems to help. i think i should get a test for add, just gotta come to terms with not having the career i want lol",0,0,0,0,0.9999187,8.1348335e-05

ku1sxo,rowing ,"how do i get a boyfriend?. hi, i'm 23 years old and i have never had a boyfriend. currently, i don't even have friends due to my social anxiety. i've lost my best friend after graduating from high school. she wanted to hang out with me and stay friends but i wanted to stop socialising and hide at home instead. that was around 2015. then i started studying, i met a few people but there were always only fellow students to me, nothing more. now due to covid, i study and work from home and don't see anyone except for my parents and my brother. but the sad thing is, it really doesn't make any difference, it's not like i've been talking to other people before anyways. i can honestly say: apart from my family, no one fucking knows me. i mean, some people back from my school days or from work or uni may know my name but that's about it. sometimes, it makes me sad but i know that i've wanted that the whole time. i've basically worked towards that by always fleeing from any possibly social interaction in the past. i've had so many chances but i always ran away from them. other than the years before, i felt a lot different in 2020. i worked on myself a lot. i started to workout on my rowing machine, i got my driving licence... i am just a lot more motivated in general. and for some reason i started to really long for a partner. i know it's stupid to look for a partner in these times and it's stupid to think that someone like me, who has never had any sort of experience, could simply go and find someone who they feel comfortable around. there are so many aggravating factors but still, sometimes, i just feel like i'm not near as ugly or stupid to deserve this solitude. i'm sick of only having crushes on men but never being able to let things actually happen. i've always had that tendency to develop crushes on older guys. for example, i've had a crush on my driving teacher. i've had my final driving test a couple weeks ago and so i don't see him anymore, but i still dream about him every now and then. he wasn't even particularly good-looking, it was simply for the fact that he had a great, clever sense of humor and he was kind. i didn't want him to think i'm weird or stupid or ugly that i barely talked. now, the dumb thing is: i know that we could have had great conversations. he always talked about random things and i wanted to talk to him the way i talk with my brother or my parents. i just wanted to be relaxed but i cared too much about his thoughts. so instead, i remained silent and boring... that's why i could probably never have a ""soulmate"": whenever i would find someone who shares my sense of humor and interests, it would make me tense up and act weird. and so, the other person would never find out that i like them or that i am likeable as well. i feel so trapped... i feel comfortable being in my bubble but i feel lonely at the same time. i wonder why everyone on freaking earth is or has been in a relationship except for me. i feel like an alien. i don't know who i am, i don't know what others see in me... i just wait for this man who can see something special in me, you know, underneath the awkwardness and shyness and everything. does anyone here have an advice or story that could help me?

ihpnvz,breeze,"my sad story. sad is the most appropriate acronym for social anxiety disorder lol i have been meaning to make this post for a while now. i am an adult now, so its easier to talk about these things as if they happened to someone else. my disorder first flared up when i was in middle school. it manifested itself as a fear of people and judgement, and i absolutely refused to go to school. it must have been really troublesome for my parents, but fortunately they took the right decision to take me to psychiatrists. unfortunately, none of those people could help me. i was diagnosed with ocd, and given medication (which i did not take at that time). my parents decided that psychiatrists or therapy was a waste of time, and decided to cure it themselves by doling out corporal punishment. i did live with strict asian parents, so this was a natural thing in society. soon afterwards, my ""condition"" got worse, and i chose to be punished rather than go to school. so that was my routine - wake up, get beat up, stay at home to enjoy my free time. when negotiation and the stick didn't work, i ultimately had to be transferred from one school to another. a new school means new people, therefore my fear of judgement subsided..for a while. i somehow managed to make it past middle school, even though the same problem happened again in the new school. i even got good grades because i was kind of smart(for a middle schooler) and studied. in highschool, things got worse, much worse. this time i got a low grade in my physics exam. due to being lonely, and always working on math problems in class (the only thing i enjoyed in school), this perception of ""bad with studies"" made me unable to go to school again. i remember those days where i would dress up as if i was going to school, and then return shortly later, overcome with fear. my father turned to alcoholism at this time point, and my mother (dealing with huge amount of stress thanks to my behavior and an absent husband) took out much of her anger on me. and therefore, i coped the only way i knew how - by shutting myself out. from middle school to high school, i had acquired a private room. and if things got worse, i would just shut myself inside. it didn't always work of course - since my parents could break down the door sometimes. sometimes i had to move the bookshelf. since my parents did not want me to die, they fed me from time to time. for me, high school was a time of total isolation. i only went out to get food. one day i found a cockroach inside my pants. cute little thing, trying to keep me company. things weren't so bad for me though. i had books to keep me company - i would read anything i got my hands on. i had a pc, and eventually internet too. i got into video games, anime, novels. i became a part of online community where i ""felt"" accepted. they were my refuge, but i think they were also things that kept me inside the dark world. porn eventually came into the picture too. it wasn't easy keeping these luxuries, so i started to fast when they took away my internet privilege. that's how i ruined my body. eventually, my parents decided that i was no longer fit to go to a proper school, so i became home schooled. this was a wise decision on their part. thanks to that, i got to slack off from studying everything except maths (the only thing i was good at). my parents hired private tutors who would literally come to teach me and fall asleep on my desk. one of those teachers tried to molest me - he (an old creepy guy) wanted to see my penis. good thing i refused. occasionally my mother lost her shit and tried to burn down the house or fight me. other than that, good times. and so i gave my exams. i expected to get good grades in maths and fail in everything else. what happened was that i failed in maths, and got a passing grade in everything else. lol. serves me right for slacking off. and so, there went my dreams of studying math in university. i did submit my answer for a regrade, and they decided to just barely make me pass math. so i was able to enroll in a shitty private college where all the failures went. at this point, something changed in me. may be it was the years of isolation, but i enjoyed class. i devoted myself to learning. i lived in a dorm about 2 hours away from home, and that was a great help since i was finally ""independent"" to a small extent. i experienced some growth. of course, years of social isolation does not make you a star at getting along with others. so i was bullied in college too (and here i thought they were adults). i guess you could say that i tried to reach the ""starting line"" that everyone else has already passed. of course, no relationships, very few friends (huge improvement) - but i spent most of my time in my studies so i never had time for that either. and i goddam enjoyed it. i was nicknamed ""the professor"", and that's where this username comes from. things got worse again though - and the pattern started to show itself. this happened as i started to question my professors on what they were teaching. remember that this was a shitty private school that i attended, so the teachers were underqualified. at this point, i had caught up with them, and i learned mostly from online courses and textbooks. this completely destroyed my reputation in college - i was despised by the teachers as being the guy who thinks he's too smart. they would literally scream at me when i pointed out their mistake. at this point, i stopped asking questions and focused on my own studies. i stopped coming to class - not because of my disorder, but because it was a waste of time. the teachers capitalized on it, and did not let me take my practical exams. thankfully, it was just plain bullying, since they didn't actually want me to fail. anyway, i passed with an average grade. that was the end of that. &amp;; ugh, i think i've typed enough. i go to a great university thanks to part luck and part hard work, i find few friends with whom i can actually connect intellectually and emotionally (sometimes). i am able to graduate with great grades. the problem manifests again, and this time it happens after i finish my masters (i underestimated my own development). \*sigh\*. stuff(coronavirus) happens, and i get two offers for phd program - and that's where i am at now. i look forward to being slave at my research institute! ah , may be this time i can finally experience ""relationship"" and ""dating"" that young people always keep talking about. or may be i'll fuck it all up and isolate myself again! whatever the case, i will move forward and find out. i hope you have learned something from my story. or at least may be it is a comfort to know that someone else is a bigger moron than you are. to those who actually read the entire thing - i apologize for taking so much of your time. i wanted to be honest, once. i don't think i can live with myself, since a lot of time i just end up distracting myself from myself. but i'll do my best. i know my limitations now. the pattern is clear to me, although my ability to deal with it is still a work in progress. i haven't seen a therapist, but i want to do it once i have some money and stability. &amp;; as i see it, the problem with sad, and people who suffer trauma and certain mental illness, is a psychological deficiency. they don't know how to live normally. and so, the resources of society are locked to them. shunned by their peers, and by themselves (especially if they don't understand what they are going through), they fall into an even darker hole. people talk all the time about ""accepting"" people with mental illness, but that actually requires the mentally ill to come out as mentally ill. i would never do that, i fear judgement, why in the world would i tell anyone this stupid story. accept your limitations for what they are, and move forward knowing that even the passing breeze can make you fall down on your face. even if you are alone, live life to the fullest. amor fati",0,0,0,1,0.111611545,0.88838845

d9zdze9,riding,"ask yourself if it's helplessness or hopelessness. if it's the latter then it almost certainly sounds like depression to me. feeling helpless is a precursor to feeling hopeless, however. i won't deny it; hopelessness is a dangerous state to be in (in fact it's the most dangerous). think about it: by feeling hopeless, you are denying that there will be *any* future, *any* relief, or *any* cure. there's a concept called learned hopelessness. this is caused by repeatedly failing when trying to change the world. the feeling that whatever you do doesn't matter. after being hit again and again by life, you come to believe that bad things just happen to you and there is nothing you can do to prevent them from happening. once you have arrived in this strange world where your efforts to change or control it don't matter, it is a short step to a sense of hopelessness. after experiencing a long string of failures, it becomes easier and easier to predict your own future. the safest prediction, given your own history, is to predict that you will fail again. once you begin to predict your own failures, you won't be disappointed because, though you may not be aware of it, you will begin to do things to ensure those failures. i want to make a point about your problems. and that is, they can have more than one outcome. when you were learning to ride a bike, what were you thinking? probably something like ""there's no hope, i won't ever be able to do this"" as you kept falling down. but then you went a few metres before falling. and then a few more. before you knew it, you riding around your block. just because we fall down, should we never try to walk? i have something for you to try. set yourself a small goal to do tomorrow. it can be anything, like tidying your room for instance. and then do it. and no matter what, no matter how crappy you feel throughout the day, force yourself to remember that you achieved that goal. the next day, set yourself another goal. then another. then a few more. this way you'll see that there *is* hope, and that you *do* have some power and control over your life. before you know it you'll be achieving big things. good luck.",0,0,0,1,6.277097e-06,0.9999937

""yeah, maybe i'm not good enough for some things, but i'm not worthless. i've made a lot of progress. i've struggled a lot. i'm still alive and still trying, and i'm gonna get to that point where i am good enough. i'm already making progress there. it's ok that i'm not where i want to be just yet. i'll get there.""nnfeel free to post, or send me a message if you want to talk.",0,0,0,0,0.99999595,4.068503e-06

nz09s1,outside,"how to turn yourself into a social butterfly. hello readers! in todays post, i will talk about my journey from struggling with social anxiety to becoming the person i am today, a social butterfly. a social butterfly is someone who is willing to take social risks and who feels little to no social anxiety in social settings. i wasnt always a social butterfly. i used to be shy, full of anxiety, and unable to express myself the way i wanted to. this was especially difficult because i was an extrovert in nature. i had a lot of energy and ideas that i wanted to express to my peers and to the world, but my mental barriers stopped me from doing so. i was forced to live the life of an introvert and this made me miserable and depressed. when i was a kid, i was happy, confident, and i had a lot of childhood friends. everything changed when my family had to move cities abruptly at the start of my first year of high school. this was about 7 years ago. moving schools and cities was a very difficult process for me. i was leaving behind all the friends i had grown up with, and i did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye and to receive closure. this closure came later, and it will be the subject of a future post. i tell you this story to tell you that my high school years were very tough. i struggled with depression, with acne, with gynecomastia, with ocd, with anxiety, and with other issues. i was out of shape, and despite wanting to be popular and have cool friends, i was lonely and felt rejected. the new friends that i had made were not considered popular and i did not feel comfortable associating myself with them. things got better in my later years of high school, but it was never the experience i had hoped for. for reference, i am now 21 years old, i am in university, and i have managed to flip my life upside down and become a social butterfly. if you were to meet me and talk to me now you would think i am a natural. it took a long time and it took a lot of me getting outside of my comfort zone and taking risks. it was a painful process and at times i didnt think it was possible. below, i will list some of the things that helped me throughout this transformation: **1) train your bold muscle.** just like we have physical muscles, we also have a social muscle, or as i like to call it, a bold muscle. every time we take a social risk, the muscle grows stronger, and our schema of the world grows. the next time we take that same risk, it is much easier to do so because we have already experienced what it is like to take such a risk. during my tough years of high school, i knew that i struggled with social skills, and i knew that the only way i could become a natural was through experience. if you are in a similar situation, understand that at the beginning of your process, being bold and taking risks will feel awkward at times and that sometimes you will think about all of these awkward moments right before going to sleep at night. however, the only way to train your bold muscle, is, well, to be bold, to take social risks, and to do the things that you are afraid of. this brings me to my next point. **2) take baby steps.** youre not going to start off as the natural guy who is able to talk to everyone in a confident manner. it will take time, and it will take baby steps. i used to try to train my bold muscle in the smallest ways possible. for example, in class, i would make it a goal to participate within the first 15 minutes. i didnt care what i said, or if it even made any sense, i simply had to raise my hand and participate within the first 15 minutes. it was a simple goal. soon, i was able to participate in class whenever i wanted. here is another example. i made it a goal to have simple conversations with people, things like saying hi to acquaintances, or asking people how their summer went. at first, i was not able to hold conversations for too long, especially with people who i saw as having more value than me, the people who i considered popular. i could only talk for a maximum of 30 seconds, and then i had to make an excuse to leave. but over time, i was able to train myself to effortlessly have conversations for however long i wanted. im at a point now where i can walk up to anyone and be confident and charismatic, and feel zero social anxiety. i am able to lead conversations and understand the nuances of body language and energy. i am able to engage people and make conversations fun and interesting. this all takes time to learn, and the only way to learn it is to practice, one little step at a time. **3) focus on becoming friends with good people rather than with popular people.** this is something that took me a long time to learn, and it was something i needed to experience to learn. i always knew this instinctively but i had to see it for myself, and maybe you need to go through that process too. i wanted to be popular and i wanted popular friends. everything changed at university. i became quite social and was able to talk to anyone, and i had some of the fun that i had missed out on in high school. i even became good friends with a few popular guys. but after spending time with people, i stopped caring about status. now, i purely care about how good a person is. i care about true friendship. i care about how honest and respectful someone is, how much i vibe with someone, whether that person truly cares for me, and whether we have similar tastes and hobbies. if your only aim is to be friends with popular people, then you are bound to fail, because your intentions are in the wrong place. this is something that youre probably going to have to learn from experience, simply reading about it might not be enough. **4) put yourself in positions to succeed.** join clubs, join a sports team, maybe even join a frat if youre in college. the point is, sometimes its too difficult to do it all yourself. sometimes you need the environment handed to you. you need a place where you can practice. you need events to go to. you need people to be around. sometimes you need the excuse of being a part of something like a team or a club in order to talk to people. **5) focus on self-improvement in other areas as well.** try to work on other areas of yourself as well. for example, i started lifting weights in high school. it took me a long time to see progress, but it was worth it. try to wear well-fitted and nice clothes, they dont have to be expensive. there are a couple of good subreddits dedicated to male fashion. get a nice haircut, and groom yourself well. find a barber that you like. study at school, read books, be creative and work on projects that you are interested in and passionate about. working on yourself in one area will make you confident in other areas and will help you on your path to becoming a social butterfly. **final thoughts.** this post is a message to all the people who are in the same position i used to be in. i know that there are probably people who are in high school or university who are going through a rough time socially. perhaps some of these people are extroverts in nature just like i am (someone who gains their energy through social interaction), but are forced to isolated lives, unable to properly express themselves because they have too many mental barriers keeping them in a state of scarcity. perhaps this is you or someone you know. perhaps you are shy and filled with social anxiety. perhaps you lack the proper role models. perhaps you are depressed. perhaps you want to be cool and popular and someone with many friends, and someone who has no fear and can express their thoughts and energy freely. perhaps you want to tame your social anxiety and become natural, to be someone who can do what they want when they want in social settings. im telling you that it can be done. practice. take baby steps. try little things.dont get upset at yourself when you fail. i used to get very upset at myself and tell myself that i hated myself, that i was a loser, and that i was going to be unhappy forever. its easy for me to sit here now and say that it wont always be like that. try to have some hope. try to take some social risks. try to build that bold muscle of yours. youll become a natural one day and maybe youll be able to help others who are struggling. youre going to go through a lot of ups and downs and a lot of failures. be kind to yourself. its a process. its not linear.progress will be good, then bad, then very bad, and then back to good. it will take time for you to reach a point where there is consistency and stability. good luck brothers and sisters. please feel free to comment, ask any questions, or direct message me asking for advice or help :)!",0,0,0,0,0.9996099,0.00039010952

98p1zl, stream,"my social anxiety story. this is gonna be a loooonng post, so i'm sorry. this is mostly for me, anyway. the bottom line is, i'm just so, so tired of being afraid all the time. every social interaction i face on a day-to-day basis makes me feel like everyone else in the room is staring at me, silently judging every word i say and every move i make. no matter how tiny and insignificant an interaction is, i still find myself thinking about it, hours or even days later. whenever i have something to say, i'm too afraid to say it. i can't initiate a conversation, and i definitely cannot ask people for things. invisible hands wrap around my throat and choke me out, screaming at me for even trying to trust myself to make my thoughts known. everything i feel and think is all bottled up in my head, begging to be set free, but my mouth won't make the words. it's been this way for years. as a child, i was totally and completely open about every thought i had. i had ""no filter"", so to speak. i didn't think about how my words and actions would make people feel, or what the consequences would be for doing the things i did. i just needed to get all my thoughts out there. i didn't know how to contain my thoughts to my own head. i didn't learn how to do that until later. understandably, this caused a lot of problems for me as a child. i was bullied a lot. like, all the time. all the other kids described me as unbearably annoying, too emotional, loud, immature, and sometimes even downright mean. nobody liked me, and i knew it. still, i didn't care too much, and simply brushed it off with the logic that all the other kids were boring assholes. i kept telling myself that, until the last months of middle school when a certain traumatic event in my life (caused entirely by me) forced me to take a step back and really start analysing who i was as a person. i felt like an awful person for what i did, and i thought maybe i deserved every hateful comment, every dirty look, and every instance of social exclusion that i had ever faced over the years. i deserved it all, for all the shit i'd said and done before, and for all the people i'd hurt just by being myself. before, i didn't give a shit; but then, i realised i hadn't been a good person, and i seriously had to change myself if i wanted to keep any of the few friends i'd actually made. i decided from that day forward that i would think before i spoke. i would no longer just say whatever was on my mind. a good idea, in theory; but i was in a bad place, and thinking about my thoughts just made me start to hate myself. i hated every thought i had. i had learned that i wasn't a good person, and i shouldn't allow myself to say or do anything that seemed even remotely unreasonable or harmful to others in any way. so, instead of speaking my thoughts out loud, i trained myself to think about what i was saying before i actually said it; a skill that comes naturally to most people, but for whatever reason, i never had until later in life. i remember my teachers and parents telling me to ""think before you act"" very often as a child, but it was just too hard. as a kid, i actually made an effort to do just that. as an easily-distracted child with adhd though, that always lasted about five minutes before i was back to acting like a fucking lunatic. anyway, that changed. i learned to think about my thoughts, which was both a blessing and a curse. i don't impulsively say things that hurt or annoy people anymore, so that's great. the problem is, now i'm afraid to say anything at all. remember when i said that i hated every thought i had, and i was constantly holding back from saying something that might hurt someone? well, i went about that entirely the wrong way. i was bullied for being ""annoying"" and ""immature"", which i guess we're the insults that i took to heart the most, because as soon as i became conscious of my own stream of thought, i started to see myself that way. i figured, why would they call me annoying for the things i say if the things i say aren't annoying? and that's when i cracked the case wide open. i was annoying! i was annoying as hell! every thought i had, i now despised. i became my own worst enemy. i became my own bully; one of the people i'd hated for so long, because they were so horrible to me. and now i thought i finally understand why. it was because i actually was just a shit person. if even i didn't want to be around me, why would anybody else?? i felt that way for years and years. only now, i've started to like myself a bit more. my thoughts no longer make me feel bad, and i've realized that i am who i am, and everyone else can either take it or leave it. i've grown as a person and become better, and learned how to contain my thoughts to myself, so that i don't hurt or annoy anybody by impulsively saying everything that comes to my mind. however, now i have crippling social anxiety, huzzah! i became so used to not saying anything, so used to just staying quiet and keeping my thoughts to myself, that i pretty much stopped making my thoughts known entirely. i just don't talk much at all anymore, because i'm so scared of becoming everything my bullies told me i was. i can't say what i think, because what if it's annoying? what if it's unnecessary, or even hurtful? i'm so hard on myself now. nothing i think to say is worth saying, in my eyes. that voice in my head keeps telling me that if i'm open and honest with myself and my feelings, all i'll do is annoy everyone and come off as some kind of freak, and i'll be outcasted again. my thoughts just aren't good enough to share with the world. i'm a fucking weirdo and i'd better just stay quiet, otherwise i'll end up driving everyone away from me. that's how my inner voice has been treating me for the past five years. i'm so afraid to speak. logically, i know that i'm a better person now, and that the people around me may actually benefit from my thoughts, but....i don't know. i still feel so much anxiety when faced with a social situation of any kind. when people speak to me, my thoughts freeze up, and i can't think of anything to say. possibly a defense mechanism? as if i'm so afraid of saying something stupid, that my brain just turns itself off? i don't know, but it fucking sucks. i wish i could turn that inner voice off. i wish i could talk to people without freezing up, or feeling so scared of what they'll think. i wish i didn't care so much about how people perceive me, but i do. i care so much. i don't want to be seen as an annoying freak ever again. i'm so afraid of being the biggest loser in the room, like when i was young. but i yearn for human contact so deeply. i feel like all these years, i've been starved of it. i feel so utterly alone all the time. i can't talk to people, though. i'm so awkward. so awkward and so, so anxious. i just want to know what it's like to be myself again.",0,0,0,0,0.99978787,0.00021217647

jhr6ob,sun,"thinking of suicide. it makes me cry thinking of leaving my sister behind and not staying for her. im not going to lull myself but i desperately wish i could in a painless easy way. all of the criticism and judgement upon me for thinking of it or pursuing it or the way im trying to survive in this world in a possible way are what lead me to this same urgency or thoughts. i imagine shooting myself in the head when i am cut off again mid sentence by my mom when i have tried to talk to her about everything thats hurting me about being in this body trapped in this mind...ive been told to man up and she purposefully doesnt listen to everything i wish i could say and now i dont know how to anyways because of how dysfunctional my mind is..i dont know how to even express myself anymore..and no point. i have no hope in my life to feel happy about myself and all i want is to learn how to survive without having to suffer more than i already am. but its probably not possible and while everyone may think im trying to cheat my way out of dealing with life like the rest of the world, i am far from the rest of the worlds capacity to endure it, others are blessed that they dont have the psychological defects that i have. i may never have a normal life or be a normal person. ive already accepted that ill never feel beautiful, ill never be able to make friends because im not like everyone else, ive lost everything i had inside of me that i loved, ive lost myself physically, ive lost myself spiritually, and mentally. ive lost everything. people dont event understand how cruel it is to downplay depression and anxiety and suspect that people are making excuses in life. im not strong enough for a damn thing in this life. i just wish i was understood and nobody ever will understand me. i feel like a child trapped in a decaying body and mind. i pretty much am. its hard to accept that im in a world where im subjected to the derogatory and profane treatment of society and others...misunderstood and not seen for the person i am inside...people may think because im an adult i deserve or can handle what sucks the life out of me and drains my soul and kills the innocence that i cant shake from inside of me. i dont want to leave myself behind to grow up and be as cruel and hardened as everyone else...i will never be able to relate to everyone else my age or desire to. i just want to live for my sister who accepts me as the strange, quiet and broken person i am. no one will ever see what is inside. i just want to die. im trying to find my ways out honestly. trying to see what path i can take to escape as much as possible..but im left to face the reality that i have to suck it up and im stronger than i think and i can do this. i am not like everyone else who has overcome everything that they have in life and became stronger. my obstacles have made me weaker. yes im sure all anyone can tell me is to see a therapist or get professional help. i dont have the time or the opportunity. i am crazy for even going on reddit of all options to vent. i guess its some form of releasing these thoughts. no matter what no one will understand how extreme what im trying and failing to describe inside of myself is. no one will ever understand and the world is unfair. and it hurts that peoples default response to those who feel this way is deal with it because lifes unfair to everyone. not everyone especially myself is built for it..and in reality no one is built for it i guess. but that just makes me far , far, far less built for it in that case. i feel like im suffocating every day with this broken mind and not being able to engage with anyone let alone i dont want to because im not the same as anyone else anyways...and im afraid of everyone because of how sensitive i am anyways..and i just dont belong in this world. and thats definitely a fact. i was supposed to be asleep a while ago and now its 3am and i dont want to see the sun rise or the light filling up the bedroom forcing me to face the day with the sleep that can barely pull me through the day even if it was nine hours of rest. i dont think even the most advanced professional in the world could help me. nothing can help me. im supposed to help myself. and i cant. i just wish i was in heaven and was never born. i hate every single day what i see in the mirror. the frown and the dullness in my skin and my hair. my lifelessness and not even seeing a person in the mirror. i cant go on and i could go on forever but i need to sleep. im stupid for posting this on reddit but that goes to show i actually dont have the appropriate resources to handle this situation. embarrassed or not i think its perfectly fine considering my sanity is already at the point of suicidal thoughts. i desperately dont want to live. i desperately wish there was a solution and there isnt. ive tried changing for years physically and mentally. im only getting worse and i cant save myself besides looking for routes that can allow me to move forward in a way that allows me to stay alive for my sister without absolutely destroying myself and getting the life pulled further out of me by others who think its completely okay to tear someone apart and treat them like their just another broad rather than the pure soul that they are. im not calling myself a pure soul in a vain way. its actually something that takes courage because its frowned upon apparently to be innocent, soft and not like everyone else. this sucks. horribly. i am so scared of shooting kuself in the head, but more scared of how that is going to effect my precious sister and nobody even those who have siblings themselves can understand the measure of love and sensitive i have for my sister...who she is to me and how precious she is..i dont want her in this horrible world without me and she needs me because her and i are the only ones who understand each other the way we do. im scared of bleeding out and im scared of my sister knowing thats the last thing i did was bless to death..thats not even everything that crosses my mind in regards to that..its much more and words dont do justice let alone im too screwed up in the head to know how to word anything. i wish the world was kind to everyone and each other let alone those who are psychologically broken and those who suffer from staying a scared child trapped in an adults body. i hate my life and all i love about my life is my sister.",0,0,0,0,0.99999535,4.639404e-06
90be29,"shore, Lake, outside ","how much does environment affect your anxiety?. for the past couple of years i haven't been happy. i've spent numerous hours just thinking and pondering and wondering why i no longer feel enlivened the way i used to, many years ago. i'm 21 years old and i'm at a stage in my life where i'm starting to question the meaning of my existence. i've given it a lot of thought and come to the conclusion that maybe it's the place in which i reside that is the source of my mood swings and anxiety. i was born in toronto and am a visible minority. for anyone who has knowledge about the city, it's extremely diverse and teeming with all sorts of ethnic cultures. when i was only 2 years old, my parents, who had lived in the city for almost their entire lives, decided to pack up and move to a little industrial city on the south shore of lake ontario known as st. catharines. i have spent the following years there ever since. toronto is where i feel i belong, and i will elaborate on that below. most of my extended relatives live in toronto. my family had work/personal ties to people living there, and for whatever reason it feels like they were happier living there too. i won't get into all the details but i'm mixed race and visibly appear to be of the visible minority side (half white, half visible minority). st. catharines is a city primarily composed of aging, white, blue collar workers, and there seems to be an air of hopelessness in the city. several years ago, a lot of the larger auto manufacturing plants here closed down when the whole nafta trade agreement came into play, costing people a lot of their jobs. as a result, there are a lot of people here on welfare or barely scraping by, which sort of lends this whole depressing atmosphere to the region. the suicide rate is also one of highest in the country, so i'm apparently not the only one who thinks the whole place is kind of a shit-show. jobs aren't really a thing here either, well, unless you would like to work retail or customer service call centre type jobs for the rest of your life. there's not much of a future here, a lot of the younger folk straight up move away because of the severe lack of good paying jobs. i had the opportunity to move back to toronto a few years ago now and refused to take the opportunity for fear of accruing too much student debt. i've been kicking myself ever since, but that now begs the question: how much does environment really affect one's mood? i'm not talking about personal relationships or how many friends one has, although that also plays a part in all this. i'm talking about demographics and small city living vs urban big city habitation. i enjoy the big city; every time i go back it just feels like home, even though i haven't lived there for most of my life. i feel like i'm missing out on all the action when i stay here, instead of experiencing the vibrancy and liveliness of a larger city. part of it is just the fact that i feel alienated somewhat since i don't fit in with the rest of the population here. people here can be sort of naive, and it doesn't help that the local university has a large international student population that i get lumped into simply because of how i look. it kinda sucks when people don't really think you're a born and bred canadian. so, with all that being said, i think that while moving back to toronto may not cure my anxiety entirely, it would certainly help a lot with my fear of people and interactions, and my unwillingness to go outside (and there's not much to do here anyway) with the exception of going to work/school. it may be expensive, but i feel like it would provide a large boost in quality of life, something i so desperately need at this point. i'm young, i should be out there experiencing new things and learning new ideas. i guess i just have to get over this fear of financially digging myself into an inescapable hole. the anonymity of a big city... it's attractive to me. am i alone in my situation? i'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter. after all, that is why i'm making this post.",0,0,0,0,0.99999464,5.3715285e-06

(very important) and started replacing them with more positive ones. i had to realise that negative thoughts are never useful. 2.) no more excuses. no more blaming other people. no more playing the victim. i took action to make my life better. ""look at me, im the captain now!"" 3.) i started reading books that were relating to anxiety, confidence and such. (i ripped them off the internet for free) the most helpful books in my case were ""the 4 agreements"", ""psycho-cybernetics"", ""the shyness and social anxiety system"" and a couple of others . reading those books was absolutely helpful. read!!! 4.) i reduced my porn consumption. ive actually stopped now, but reducing it down to once a week at most really helped, alot. 5.) i learnt to not take things personally. 6.) self acceptance! unconditional self acceptance. learn to forgive yourself, love yourself. 7.) keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. start small and build up. 8.) i built in a firm belief that all human beings are equal. some people will be better or worse at doing some things, but we are all still equal. 9.) belly breathing in stressful moments, i tried my best to not evade these stressful situations. each time you do this you build up a higher tolerance to stress and anxiety. 10.) not everyone has to like me, i wasnt put on earth to be liked. be yourself, do not seek others approval. 11.) do not fear failure, learn from it. do not believe you only have one chance, you will always get other opportunities. 12.) be patient with yourself. "" if you become 1% stronger everyday, you will become 365% stronger by the end of the year"" 13.) you need to become more self aware and learn the root cause of your anxiety. fix the leak in you boat before pumping out the water. these are some of the thing that helped me the most. looking back i cant believe how far i have come. i thought this was impossible to me back then. i went from not being able to look my best friend and even family in the eye to having my lunch out with 5 girls on my table (table for 6). i wish all you guys the best of luck, you will beat this. i have nothing but love for you all. please dont hesitate to ask me anything. survive-&gt;live-&gt;thrive",0,0,0,0,0.99999726,2.768606e-06

bpwnne, sand,"my exposure therapy log. hey guys! i decided to start doing exposure therapy on myself to work on my social anxiety. a little about me. ive been suffering with social anxiety for years, and as im sure most of you have experienced, ive missed out on so much because of it. in the last year ive made pretty good progress. i started going to a club on my campus to get out more and i made a few friends there, ive also been reconnecting with old friends from high school and hanging out with them too. im still not where i wanna be though and my social anxiety still gets to me in many situations. because of that ive decided to do 20 days of rejection/shame therapy. the basic idea is that you do something weird or embarrassing in public to desensitize yourself to those feelings. it also helps you put things into perspective as peoples reactions are usually not as severe as we imagine theyll be. i wanted to put my experience on reddit to help encourage others who struggle with social anxiety and want to try exposure therapy. day 1: ask three strangers for a piece of gum. i went to a grocery store kinda far from where i live to do this. my first person was this little old lady. i was so so nervous, i almost didnt go up to her. its so funny thinking about how scared i was of a sweet old grandma. i managed to walk up to her though and asked her if she had a piece of gum. she let out a little laugh and said sorry i dont. it didnt last more than ten seconds but it was so powerful, i really had nothing to be afraid of. the second person was a middle aged woman. i went up to her sand asked the same thing. she said sorry no and gave me a little weird look. that one was way easier, only about a quarter of the anxiety. last one was a middle aged guy who was talking on the phone. i got his attention and ask for a piece of gum, he told the person on the phone to hold on and asked me to repeat what id said. i asked him again and he said sorry but he doesnt have any gum. he almost looked like he was genuinely sad he couldnt give me any. so thats day one down. the difficulty of the challenges will go up as i go on but todays challenge was a great way to start.",0,0,0,0,0.99999523,4.8220722e-06

8q4n1h,sun,"social anxiety sucks but it's not the end of the world.. long. a little background here... i'm a 20 year old male with pretty severe anxiety and a very mild form of autism known as pdd. having pdd means essentially that mentally you're always going to be a few years behind. mentally i feel like i'm 14 or 15, but at least i'm mature enough now to recognize that. maturity wise i've always been 4 or 5 years younger, so hopefully as i get older i'll eventually start acting my age. so this disorder first really became a problem in middle school, after going through a traumatic event. i was popular in elementary school (everyone thought i was funny), but i became socially withdrawn. i was put on heavy doses of experimental medication though, which, while cured my social anxiety and depression, turned me into a psychotic, narcassistic, fat freak who had no emotion and didn't give a shit about anything but me. i eventually (over the course of years), got off of everything because the meds were killing me physically and psychologically. this is when my social anxiety returned with a vengeance, and became unbearable. in 10th grade i transferred to a small private school for troubled teens after moving out of an **autism** school i had been in for 2 years (the meds pretty much made me lose control over my behavior completely, public wasn't an option anymore). i was so scared of people that i couldn't make eye contact, could barely speak up at all. when i did, i always embarassed myself. i'm sure people thought i was slow or something. i ended up getting convinced that the only way to control my anxiety was through illegal drug use. yes, my plan was to smoke weed and abuse xanax among other things so i didn't embarass myself everywhere i went. and, yeah, i got involved in some pretty heavy drug use. it did cure my social anxiety, though, for the most part (heavy xanax and alcohol intake, that is). i ended up making some friends (most i'm still close with), keep a job and excel at it, and i even (sort of) lost my virginity.... but the excessive drug use was a nightmare. my doses kept going up and up, and every time i tried to taper i'd just become a psycho. they were hitting the danger zone; i was seriously afraid stopping them would kill me. i was up to an equivalent of 50mg xanax daily, an absurd amount. since withdrawals off this shit can be deadly and because i was a junkie i felt like stopping wasn't an option. i ended up being so depressed i woke up every day wishing i was dead. i became an obnoxious, cruel narcissist. never accepted blame for anything. bitched constantly. manipulated people. i was just out of touch. and i was dopesick all the time too. always in pain. when i had sex for the first time i could barely get it up even though i loved the girl (i still do), which was embarassing and painful. things ended horribly with her, and i've got nobody but myself to blame for that. even most of my friends couldn't stand to be near me and those who could were also really out of touch. parents were saying literally every day that they were going to kick me out, and they were searching my room every day and finding shit. even though i worked 40 hours a week, pretty much every penny i made went to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. it was awful; i turned into a junkie and an asshole nobody wanted to be around. one night, a week or so after me and my ex cut things off, i took an unusually high amount of benzos and drank about a bottle of vodka when i was out with friends. i barely remember coming home that night. woke up in a cell. they said i assaulted my stepdad and attacked cops who showed up after. the guy was sick of my shit, rightfully so i see now, and wanted to bust me. damn did i get busted. i ended up spending 77 days in what was essentially prison (a step up from the county jail, where real inmates go), had to detox cold-turkey. it was brutal and lasted a month, but i'm alive. i was convicted of 5 misdemeanors in jail and i now have to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet (which i've worn since april). i have a felony (assault on officer) pending, but if i don't break the lengthy conditions of my probation for another 60 days, i'll only get 3 more misdeamors (huzahh). things are fucking tough right now. my social anxiety is back with a vengeance, and, again, everyone thinks i'm autistic as fuck. hell, i even started writing this in the first place because someone at work today said i was ""slow"", because the intense stress i have to deal with makes it very hard to focus on work and process info. work is torture because the last thing i want to do right now is communicate with anyone and doing that all day makes me extremely, extremely uncomfortable. interacting with strangers and coworkers aside, i even feel like i lost the ability to relate to anyone, including close friends. it fucking sucks. things are getting better, slowly, however. i was put on 50mg zoloft a month ago and i have to say i'm surprised at just how effective this is. i'm able to get out of bed, i don't dwell on things as much, talking to people isn't *totally* impossible, and i'm finally seeing the obvious error in my ways and trying to make amends with anyone i've hurt. my apologized to my mom, who understood, thank god, and told me something i won't forget: ""when you're so caught up in how awful *you* feel, it's understandable that it's hard to see things from another person's perspective."" i'm making amends with my stepdad, who i used to think was satan incarnate. i see now he isn't such a bad guy as long as you're not breaking every law under the sun in his house. even made up with my ex, who said she'd ""be there for me, forever and always"". i really don't deserve people this understanding. a friend of mine who used to not be able to stand me because of my bitching ended up hanging out with me a few times and had a lot of fun. i remember him saying, ""are you cutting the bitching out just because i'm around?"" people really aren't so bad, i've found; i can't understand why i'm still so terrified of them. but things are getting better slowly. i actually think that, if i just keep working hard, saving up money, focusing on sobreity, et cetera, i have a bright future ahead of me. because i'm not dumb and because people in much worse situations than me have made it out alive by giving it their all. every time i'm at work, and i'm tired, and people are making fun of me, and i'm so uncomfortable i'm studdering, i just keep thinking about my ex, how she, for example, worked 60 hours a week just to stay alive on her own at 18 to escape from an abusive household. i could be in a much, much worse situation and i'm a wuss if i continue to just blame everything on my anxiety and other people, and never take the steps myself to improve my life. a quote from my absolute favorite show, a legit masterpiece and a work of art, *neon genesis evangelion*, is something i live by day to day; ""as long as the sun, the moon, and the stars exist, you will always have a *chance* to be happy. after all, you are **alive**, make the most of it."" anyone who actually read this, thank you so much. this is really my life story more than anything and if i'm being totally honest i wrote this as a form of therapy. i went overboard, but if my story reaches someone, somewhere and helps someone out in some way, shape or form, i'm glad. we're all in this together, we're never alone in our struggles. tldr: it may seem like rock bottom now, and daily life may be a very real struggle. but there is *always* a *chance* at happiness as long as you are alive no matter how hopeless it all may seem. tldr 2: zoloft induced rant tbh",0,0,0,0,0.9997538,0.00024620703

d2n662s,"outside , mountain","basically i'd describe ssris as making everything ""easier"" by decreasing how much you care about things. let's say normally you give 90% too much of a fuck about social situations, then on ssris (or zoloft, at least) it makes you give about 50% less of a fuck about everything. tasks that used to be extremely demanding, both physically and mentally, due to anxiety, suddenly felt trivial, like they simply weren't big deals. they felt easy. i was in college when i started meds, and back then one of my biggest fears (one of many) was about eating in public places by myself; too anxious to sit alone in a crowded dining hall surrounded by groups of friends for fear of being judged or secretly made fun of, or just looking pathetic, i would often try to avoid getting food until the busiest hours were over. eventually i figured a system out and would go get dinner at 8pm, half an hour before they closed, when it was practically empty and the only people left were other loners like myself, or people who had night classes, or nerds who were studying while eating. if not that, i would just get in, get food, get out, and go eat in my room. there were several nights in my first month at college where i waited too long to leave my dorm because i couldn't bring myself to face the outside world, and the cafeteria ended up closing, and i spent the night hungry and feeling ashamed for being too weak to take care of myself. just one of several nerve-wracking scenarios i had to deal with everyday for my first semester, until i decided to go on medication. started taking zoloft on my first day back in january. there were some physical side effects at first, mainly upset stomach, then lethargy and extreme tiredness, then feeling apathetic and zombie-like, then after 3 weeks i started to notice the positives. the apathy never went away--and it was what made the drug work. it just made me not care about stuff anymore. i stopped caring about what people were thinking of me when i walked by, what people thought of how i was dressed or how my hair looked, what people thought when i was acting awkward, what people thought when they saw me eating alone, what people thought in general, and about life in general. everything was just ""meh"" to me and nothing really fazed me, so the physical symptoms associated with anxiety also stopped. no more nervous sweating, no heart racing, no trembling, no knots in my stomach. i spent the remaining semester in a sort of zen-like daze (or is it haze? i don't know), in this false trance-like state where i was no longer an anxious person. let me repeat: it made me not care about stuff anymore. this included academics. after a disastrous first semester where i failed two classes and just barely passed a third, i was determined to turn things around and get my act together. then the ssris kicked in, pretty quickly actually, and i said fuck that. i started routinely skipping class whenever i didn't feel like going and just stopped doing homework overall (think peter gibbons in office space). i was more relaxed than ever and had more mental clarity than ever because the drugs cleared the fog away and let me see the world for what it objectively was, unobscured by the anxiety that once plagued my head, and i could clearly see what i cared about and what i didn't. apparently i didn't care about grades or my academic future because i basically set myself up for failure right from the start--the first week of classes was the only week that whole semester where i attended all of my classes. the following week, i didn't attend a single one. i just sort of realized i didn't care, i didn't care if i failed or not, i didn't care what my professors thought, i didn't care what my family thought, i didn't care what anyone thought of me anymore. those were the most honest four months of my life. after returning home for the summer, and after my parents discovered that i had failed another 3 classes, i decided i didn't care about college at all and spontaneously opted to drop out and go out on my own to try and find work. i spent the rest of that year on ssris, and it was a great year, actually the best year of my life, and the only year i can look back on fondly. at the end of it, though, i decided i didn't want to use meds as a crutch anymore; i was finally feeling good about life, and about myself, and i figured i'd rather learn to cope with the world on my own, without drugs to guide me through it, so i stopped taking them. ssris had helped me climb most of the mountain, and i was determined to get to the top myself, without anyone else's help. this is the happy ending version of the story. the real ending, though, the sad one, is that i progressively got worse an worse over the next year as the fog rolled back into my head. the anxiety slowly crept back up on me, and continues to do so, along with depression, my old friend. now i'm sort of back on meds, except these meds are actually alcohol, and i hate myself all the time. **tl;dr ssris can make everything easier, thereby freeing you up to lead a more fulfilling life**",0,0,0,0,0.99997175,2.8295564e-05
d624ef7,mountain,"the simplest way i can describe it is if your anxiety is normally at 90%, ssris bring it down to 40%. the fog gradually clears as the meds enter your system and you just sort of stop caring about everything, which paves the way for unhindered, unbiased decision making; simple, mundane tasks that would normally be nerve-wracking suddenly seem easy and trivial. it's like a tremendous weight has been lifted off of your shoulders--you're still carrying some of it, but most of it is being carried by the ssris now. everything is lighter and simpler. i was on sertraline for a year but i ultimately decided to go off it because i wanted to try combating sa on my own; at the time, i was in a place where i felt confident enough in myself to continue on without meds, because my life had been turned around and i was actually happy; it was like the meds helped me get partway up the mountain, and now i was strong enough and brave enough to climb the rest of it alone. unfortunately, over the next few weeks, as the drugs left my system, i felt the weight of anxiety slowly return and place itself on my shoulders again, getting heavier and heavier and heavier until it was unbearable and morphed into 24/7 depression, neurosis, and self-hatred. this is where i am now and this is why i'm considering talking to a doctor again for round 2 of ssris.",0,0,0,0,0.9999989,1.1245036e-06

ikd1pg,"park, walk","i (21m) am now in a friend group in college but i fear i'm too quiet for them.. the title mostly says it. the saturday before my sophomore semester began, my college had a screening of the first jurassic park film and i went on my own because of course, i would. i had some brief convos with some familiar classmates from the previous classes that i had during my freshman year and that's where all my social interactions ended. i even sat by myself during the film whereas most people sat with fellow classmates. i was fine with it but thought it would be nice to have some friends to enjoy the film with. when jurassic park was over, i walked over back to my ride to get back home. on the way, a couple of girls shouted, ""hey, you!"" to me. i turned around and saw them walking towards me. let's call them by the first letters of their first names (a and j). they actually took note of how i was sitting by myself and that i needed some new friends in my college life. a asked for my instagram, i asked for j's instagram and we became a friend group after i threw my twin brother into it as well. the girls seemed to want to be close to us as they asked us to do so many activities with them from a hip hop dance demo class (my brother and i were the only guys there) to a trivia night (of which we actually won). after the trivia night, a decided to lunge into me for a long hug where we even swayed for a bit. unfortunately, that night is going to be really hard to top. and my brother and i have been pretty quiet and shy around them. they still act really friendly around us and find whatever reason they can to take a selfie of all four of us in the same photo. however, due to me not offering enough to the table as i feel i should, i fear that i'm losing them and losing the deepness of this friendship. the last time i saw j, she still wanted to hang out with us (a wasn't present on campus), but i got the vibes that we were losing her. it appears to me that while j still very much wants to be friends, she seems to be at her best when a is around. it's like when i was younger, i was so insecure that i was in no established friend groups, and now that i am, i feel like i have work to do to maintain these friendships even though i still very much enjoy their company. sorry for the long post. if you have questions, feel free to ask.",0,0,0,0,0.9999808,1.9133933e-05

iy3t0s,outside,"sudden onset and hindsight. mostly just talking here but also welcome the thoughts of whoever can relate somehow. i dont know if anyone remembers a distinct beginning to their anxiety; the funny thing is i do: i was a straight a honor student. then in eighth grade i sat at the breakfast table, doing my homework - and all of a sudden i wondered, why bother. why finish this assignment, and why keep trying to make friends or be happy. so i just stopped- well, i couldnt continue. it was seriously that sudden- i had energy and in a second i didnt. it never returned; i mostly flunked eighth grade to sophomore year, because none of it seemed to matter. for so long i wondered: what caused that change? yet honestly? looking back now its obvious. i was extroverted but had no friends because everyone thought i was a jerk. we also moved constantly. my family didnt help things by telling me to focus on academics - but i had no social rewards to reap as a result of doing that, apart from a distant chance at wealth. my parents wanted me to stay a kid, and to be theirs, free from the poisonous influence of outsiders. they pretty much encouraged me to be a dick, telling me all other kids were assholes and i was better than them. so i treated others like shit while craving their promised acceptance. i was socially feral, not happy, and no one gave me a choice or permission to be happy or socialize, outside flinging insults and telling me my inherent superiority would someday win and i would be justified. but as smart as everyone told me i was? i couldnt see or understand that those stresses were probably the reason i shut down, until -decades- later. i blamed myself for the eighth grade moment and got confused; or i blamed nothing, and got angry. but it continued; from that moment i stopped being able to verbalize, or socialize with others outright- alongside a number of other depression and anxiety related issues. i wish i could go back in time, back to when i still had the energy i had before eighth grade (which i never got back- and im 35 now.) i wish i could tell myself: figure out what makes you happy, while you can. dont just try to be what your parents want- and dont listen to them when they tell you how much better you are than everyone. listen to people; share joy with them, and stop doing things that make you miserable just because youre told. maybe then i would have avoided the trigger event- what was always a possibility from my chemistry/genes, but i could perhaps have staved off by being better taken care of when i was too young to know better. or - maybe it was inevitable anyway and i wouldnt listen. but 22 years later i feel the lost chance. i sought therapy/medical help and it never worked. no friends, no desire to make them despite longing for the idea. i had a few good years but they were brief and ended very poorly, long ago. no family, no kids- ugh.",0,0,0,0,0.99993634,6.3639025e-05

jah8qi,"nature, walk","how i turned myself into a social butterfly. hello! i wasn't always a social butterfly. i used to be shy, full of social anxiety, and unable to express myself the way i wanted to. this was especially bad, because i was in nature an extrovert. i was someone who had a lot of energy to express, but whose mental barriers stopped him from doing so. i was forced to live the life of an introvert and this made me depressed. when i was a kid, i was a happy one. everything changed when my family had to move cities abruptly at the start of my first year of high school. this was about 6 or 7 years ago. it was a very difficult process for me, i was leaving behind all my childhood friends, and i did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye and to receive closure. this closure came later, when i went to revisit my old school and my old friends a couple of times. i tell you this story to tell you that my high school years were very tough. i was struggling with depression, with acne, with gyno, with ocd, with anxiety, and with a bunch of other issues. i was out of shape, and despite wanting to be popular and have cool friends, i was very lonely and felt rejected. the friends that i did have were considered ""losers"" and i did not want to associate myself with them. i became a bit of a loner. for reference, i am now 20 years old, and i am in university, and i have managed to flip my life upside down, and become a social butterfly. it took a long time and it took a lot of ""risks"". it was a painful process and at times i didn't think it was possible. below, i will list some of the things that have helped me throughout my process: **1) you need to train your ""bold"" muscle.** just like physical muscles, we have a social muscle, or as i like to call it, a ""bold"" muscle. every time we take a social risk, the muscle grows stronger, and our schema of the world grows. the next time we take that same risk, it is much easier because we have already experienced what it is like to take such a risk. during my tough years of high school, i knew that i had very little social skills, and i knew that the only way i could become a ""natural"" was trough experience. it will feel cringe. it will feel awkward. you'll probably be thinking about all of these awkward moments right before going to sleep at night. however, the only way to train your ""bold"" muscle, is, well, to be bold, to take social risks, to do things that you are afraid of. this brings me to my next point. **2) baby steps.** you're not going to start off as the natural guy who is able to talk to anyone in a confident manner. it will take time, and it will take baby steps. i used to try to train my ""bold"" muscle in the smallest ways possible. for example, in class, i would make it a goal to participate within the first 15 minutes. i didn't care what i said, or if it even made any sense, i simply had to raise my hand and participate within the first 15 minutes. that was a simple goal. soon, i was able to participate in class whenever i wanted. another example, is that i made it a goal to have simple conversations with people. saying hi to acquaintances, or asking people how they're summer went. at first, i was not able to hold conversation for too long, especially with people who i saw as having more value than me, the people who i considered popular. i could maybe only talk for 30 seconds, and then i had to make an excuse to leave. but over time, i was able to train myself to effortlessly have conversation for however long i wanted. i'm at a point now where i can walk up to anyone and be confident and charismatic and feel zero social anxiety. **3) focus more on goodness rather than status.** this is something that took me a long time to learn, and it was something i needed to experience to learn. i always knew this instinctively but i had to see it for myself, and maybe you need to go through that process too. i always wanted to be popular and so i always wanted popular friends, and i did not care enough about my ""loser"" friends. everything changed in university. i became quite popular, and was able to talk to anyone, and i had some of the fun that i had missed out on in high school. i even became good friends with quite a few popular guys. but after spending time with people, i stopped caring about status. now, i purely care about how good a person is, i could care less if they are popular. i care about true friendship. i care about how honest and respectful someone is, how much i vibe with someone, whether that person truly cares for me, whether we have similar tastes and hobbies... if you're only aim is to be friends with popular people, then you are bound to fail, because your intentions are in the wrong place. but this is something that you're probably going to have to learn from experience, simply reading it won't do anything. **4) put yourself in positions to succeed.** join clubs, join a sports team, maybe even join a frat if you're in college. the point is, sometimes it's too difficult to do it all yourself. sometimes you need the environment handed to you. you need a place where you can practice. you need events to go to. you need people to be around. sometimes you need the excuse of being a part of something like a team or a club in order to talk to people. **5) self-improvement in other areas.** try to work on other areas as well. for example, i started lifting weights in high school. it took me a long time to show progress, but it was worth it. try to wear well-fitted and nice clothes, they don't have to be expensive. there are a couple cool subreddits dedicated to male fashion. get a nice haircut, and groom yourself well. find a barber that you like and stick with him. study at school, read books, be creative and work on projects and interests that you find interesting. i have a long way to go to figure things out, but simply working on yourself will make you confident in other areas too and will help you on this path to becoming a social butterfly. **final thoughts.** this entire post is a message to my old self. i know that there are probably people who are in high school or perhaps even younger or older, who are going through a tough time. perhaps they are extraverts in nature just like i was (someone who gains their energy through social interaction), but perhaps they have too many mental barriers. perhaps they are shy and filled with social anxiety. perhaps they lacked the proper role models. perhaps they are depressed. perhaps they want to be cool and popular and someone with many friends, and someone who has no fear and can express themselves freely. perhaps they want to tame their social anxiety and become natural, to be someone who can do what they want when they want in social settings. i'm telling you that it can be done. practice. baby steps. try little things. **don't get upset at yourself.** i used to get so upset at myself, i'd tell myself that i hated myself, that i was a loser, that i was going to be unhappy forever. it's easy for me to sit here now and say that it won't always be like. but try to have some hope. try to take some social risks, build that ""bold"" muscle of yours. you'll become a natural one day and maybe you'll be able to help some others. you're going to go through a lot of ups and downs, a lot of failures. be kind to yourself. **it's a process. it's not linear.** it will be good, then bad, then very bad, and then back to good. it will take time for you to reach a point where there is consistency and stability. good luck brothers and sisters. please feel free to comment, ask any questions, or to direct message me asking for advice or help :)",0,0,0,0,0.9999908,9.123912e-06

""just go out and talk to people"". i moved away from everything i was familiar with, including my few friends. i was terrified. and she just told me ""go out and make friends"" because she views me as a loner. she said it as if it's easy, like you go outside and boom a friend. i think she's still stuck in the perspective of being sat with someone in a classroom. she also likes the idea of going to pubs and restaurants (which i hate, it's my worst nightmare). she's been supportive up until recently and now all i get is a ""that's your problem to deal with, not mine"" when i'm just expressing stress. i never even asked for her to coddle me, i was just venting. quarantine has made things worse, i no longer work a customer service job (which initially helped me a lot with communication) but i never made friends with anyone. if anything i made enemies. once lockdown restrictions ease up my current coworkers will most likely invite me out. how do i push down the feeling that they're just being nice out of pity? the looming feeling that they don't actually want to be around me? they're the same people but it's a different setting. i haven't been to a pub in months. i've never been to the pub they go to. the thought of it all makes me want to cry and hide. i can get so scared to the point i can't even talk. i haven't been to a shop for 6 months. i hate going anywhere alone. another one of my friends hypocrisies is that i need to brave up and go on my own to places whilst also preaching about how unsafe women are on their own in public. how is that supposed to make me feel better when i'm literally the world's easiest target? i'm supposed to just go out and talk to people whilst also avoiding people because they could have malicious intentions and i'd make myself a target but then it's be my fault because i spoke to that person. i'm trying to understand her points but she just contradicts herself and it's not helping me. i have a hard enough time figuring out social interactions and for her to just hit me with those is really confusing. she'll probably see this. i'm scared, i'm lonely, i feel like everyone only talks to me out of pity.",0,0,0,0,0.9999323,6.7684996e-05

oi59y5,running,"feeling hopeless and need to vent. 24m here feeling like i just need to get some stuff out somewhere and hopefully this is allowed here. so a little background first i guess: i've always been a quiet kind of guy, friends were made through friends of people i know and kind of sat back and let conversations play out. well a few years ago i moved away from one of the few towns i've called home to start a life with my partner on the other side of the country (uk) and due to that stopped talking to the few friends i had as i was struggling to keep my life afloat just with work and figuring out the ins and outs of running a household. throw in a few traumatic life events and i basically just imploded. should probably also mention i've been dealing with depression for over a decade. anyway, not talking to my family and friends for a long time seems to have thrown me into my anxiety tenfold. even though i now have more contact recently with my sister and my mother, with whom it's always been close-knit amongst the three of us, and i have no trouble with talking or explaining things to my amazingly supportive partner; with all others, even once close friends, i just can't bring myself to initiate a conversation let alone hold one together. it makes me feel like a sociopath sometimes, like when one of my previously close friends who asks my family about me a lot suffered a bereavement recently. i had to look up and ask my partner how i should express my condolences! i just couldn't think of what to say and this has happened for multiple different occasions. i can't even start a conversation with people who i might want to get to know as the question of how they're doing or general ice breakers don't occur to me, my mind just goes blank and i can't think of anything. the worst part for me is that it's not just limited to face to face. talking to others online, be it through a chat or even voip in games (i hate to imagine a video call!), i can't bring myself to interact with anyone as there is a constant deep feeling of fear that i struggle to overcome. even as i type this i am second guessing myself and wondering whether to even post it. i think that's probably all i have to say at the moment, i just needed to get it out i guess. here's hoping the stronger prescription and a third/fourth year of talking therapy might help solve my issues. if you made it this far, thank you for reading, hope it didn't get anyone else feeling down",0,0,0,0,0.9999857,1.4247924e-05
okg98f,run,"it's possible, i'm getting better. hi friends, i wanted to share an exciting revelation i've had, which is that my social anxiety is getting better. i am overjoyed about this because not long ago i was thinking i would be this way forever, but alas. we always dread the fact that if you want to get better you have to do the uncomfortable part of socializing. yes, i think this is certainly part of it. but there's also some key mindsets i've found myself in that i really think help as well. i thought i'd share them in the hopes that they inspire someone. sorry, it turned out long, but hopefully worth the read!... self-forgiveness. this is huge. i think it's massively importantly to be so, so utterly kind to yourself. when you slip up and say something cringe, try to laugh and move on. when you fail to go to that event, think of it as your disorder acting up -- not that you failed -- and forgive yourself. talk to yourself as you would a friend, or a younger sibling, or even a child. we are all deserving of nothing but kindness from ourselves. boundaries. specifically, when to push them and when to reinforce them. this is all up to your gut and your knowledge of yourself and obviously look different for everyone. for example, i would never go to a bar -- it's simply not in my character. that is a boundary i have chosen to adhere to, and we all are allowed and deserving of boundaries in life. if someone were to ask me to go to one i would simply suggest a cafe instead. on the flip side, going on a blind date is something i recently did, and it was certainly a push of my boundaries. but i knew that the fear of the date was just my anxiety. so i went. it was super hard but i knew it was a boundary i could challenge -- knowing that if i ""failed"", i could forgive myself and move on. don't be ashamed. talk openly. this is very uncomfortable at first, i really struggled to tell anyone about my social anxiety for years. but i promise it is the right thing to do. tell a parent, a friend, a stranger. you've already made one step by joining this sub. i find that speaking about it through social media is much easier (maybe some of you find this, too?) and so i do it readily, there. this disorder, and the spectrum of introversion, have really come out a lot in the past year and a half in mainstream media. we can be accepted. take covid as a positive. of course this is a terrible pandemic but if we get a little more personal for a sec, we can see the good in it! i have used covid as a practice run for when we open up again. behind a screen with my camera off i have been given the opportunity to ""mute"" and ""unmute"" as i see fit, practicing for when i go back to school and am expected to speak in critiques, meetings, what have you. with everyone living moreso at our pace of live this past year + 1/2, this is a time for us to take a deep breath, practice good habits, and get ready to slowly face the world. of course, all of these things can only happen if you want them to. we do have control over our lives, as much as we sometimes like to pretend it's not up to us. getting better begins with a choice. i really recommend you take it. i've never been happier in my life than now, as i start to see progress. for reference, i am 21 years old and have dealt with social anxiety maybe my whole life, but notably since i was 12. i give you this reference because i want you to know that this takes time. i don't mean to say that all of this is easy, because it's certainly not. but keep pushing. keep testing your limits, and saying ""yes"", and practicing, and you can get there too. thanks for reading, i hope someone does at least. this is really exciting to me.",0,0,0,0,0.9998062,0.00019383428

oxks2a,pool,"i have given up on human connection at this point.. where do i start with this post? i don't even know if this is the right place because i struggle with social anxiety. i'm currently 25 years old. i don't really have friendships to speak up and admittedly, have never been kissed, still have the v card, and never had a girlfriend. long story short, was never the type to make friends in my upbringing. so by the time high school came, i didn't really participate in the social aspects of it. i admit it. my mother has played a dominating presence in my life. financials greatly impacted my college experience. i really wanted to move out for my college experience. i and my mother had intense arguments but ultimately there wasn't anything i could do. so i lived at home through my college years. been working and living at home ever since. i have never moved out until now. looking back, i was greatly naive on just how expensive college was. i have come to understand where my mother was coming from. i can't help however but resent everything how it went down. to this day, i still desire the college experience i never got to have. but the person i hate the most is in fact me. i should have worked harder in high school. i wish i was more aware. maybe i could have gotten a scholarship at ucla or another uc and used that to my leverage to force my mom's hand. i'm 25 now but lacking the social moments that my peers my age have already had already. to put it short, i'm the book on the shelf that is covered in dust. i am in fact 18 years old in my own mind. it's taken a while but i've come to accept that i will never have the college experience i desired nor is my adolescence or early 20's gonna come back. but i will not lie and say i don't really like what's potentially in front of me. people my age are busier are now. their social groups are closed and even if you happen to find a social group of people my age, i'll feel like i'll be the least important member of the group as i came in so late. whatever friend i make at this point, i just can't but be unsatisfied. i admit it's shallow but even if i find that one rare good friend, i can't help but see that we're all adults now. the biggest of all, despite sometime left, marriage and children are something that is beginning to loom. i will most likely never have a period in my life where my friends can be just that. my friends. without the whole stupid cycle of returning to suburbia. i still want to do dumb teenage things. crazy parties and raves till dawn. experimenting drugs on the body. coachella. overly passionate young romance. but i know people my age don't want to do these things as they use to. i can't help but feel alone in my age group. to the people my age and older, having dinner doesn't really count. why would i want to be friends with an age group that i know will leave the party early? if it was up to me. yes. every single person in my friend group would be around 18 to 20. same thing goes for my romantic relationships. but i also recognize that chances of having relationships like this are low and society will hate me for it. my only defense is, having friends of that age and being romantically involved with someone that age is just better suited for my maturity and is more practical for the long term. to the women my age, i'm sorry. but marriage and children is something i won't be ready for until my early 40's at the very latest, and that's only if i get lucky. i am not all out on marriage and children, but this societal pressure scares me. i resent the fact that people my age are practically my pool for human connection. even though it is never coming back, being an adolescent is still something i want. social interaction at this age just feels so different and i don't like it. my adolescence is something that is always going to be unfulfilled. even though i don't think someone you only see once in three weeks is really your friend, adult friendships are all that i have. i have thought about my long-term goal of moving to france but like i posted here, socially what would it give? the more i get older, the fewer people want friends especially as an english-speaking foreigner. i still lean towards pursuing this goal only because of potential eu citizenship. socially, however, the social rewards would not be as fruitful as i didn't reach france till older age. in actuality, i expect no reward at all other than becoming a french citizen. in summary, i have given up on friendship, finding a partner, and human connection in general. it's kinda too late for me. even though i vastly overshared on this post, i can't help but feel empty. i attempted suicide just nearly one year ago today. my family still doesn't know that i tried to drown myself in san francisco. however, i'm willing to do it again. maybe in europe this time. i feel like i want my adolescence more than i want life at this moment. i mean it when i say i want to die. i want to remove myself from the picture. i apologize for such a long post.",0,0,0,0,0.99997807,2.1978503e-05

pdmvzc,"running, park, run","slowly realizing that i may be an introvert after a life of being a strong extravert and it's freaking me out (thoughts appreciated). (reposting this here, as i'm not sure if this post is more appropriate for r/introvert or r/socialanxiety. thus, i'm posting it in both) hey all! i found this community today and wanted to journal a bit a lot of self-reflection i have had recently, hoping someone here can relate. it's going to be long, but i hope somebody reads it and gives me their thoughts on my experience, whether you share them or disagree with them. i am 25, queer, i live in a big american city, and i have adhd. i only learned recently that i have adhd, although i had suspected it my whole life. i have always been super chatty and will talk anyone's head off who will listen. it's actually something that has always made me really self-conscious, as i notice when people tune me out or try to change the topic to get me to stop rambling. and i know i would be annoyed by someone hogging all the conversation space too. but it feels like there is this motor running in me, like if i don't let my friends know my each and every thought that they will forget about me or i will fall apart. thus, i recently realized these (along with other things) probably lead me to living with high-functioning adhd, and may explain why i have been so freaking anxious my whole life. because of this chattiness, i have always given people the illusion that i am super outgoing and extraverted. i started noticing how great this felt to have people think this about me when i was in high school. i met a ton of new faces and quickly many people knew who i was, mostly because i would talk to everyone and actively try to befriend everyone. at the time, it was really freeing, given how small my school was that fed into my high school, as it was the first time in my life that i was being introduced to an entire new and expanded community of people. i was also in the closet and probably hated myself deep down, so it felt good to have other people tell me how great and popular i was, as i didn't actively think those things about myself. i think around here i made an association that having a lot of friends and being extraverted was the ideal, and that only through knowing more and more people can you meet the right people that will give you cool experiences, a great relationship, or even just funny stories. i didn't want to miss out on all of that, so i worked to make as many friends as i possibly could. then, i went out-of-state for college and the same thing happened again. i think of being a college freshman and how excited i would be that over 400 people chose to like my instagram post. it made me feel successful, like i was succeeding in life because 400 people actively chose to double tap on my photo and assert that they at least don't fucking hate me. it was really scary, however, moving to school and having to socially start over for the first time in my life. i would be so excited for breaks so i could go home and sit alone in my suburban house with my parents and just breathe and feel okay being alone. it felt like at school there was never a moment to catch my breath, as there was always pressure to go to another party, another extracurricular, another study session, another sexual hookup... ...but i was being told by everyone that i had so many friends and made them jealous. so, in my mind, it was worth it because \*it was working,\* i was now successful because i was adored by many. i know this sounds super pretentious but i'm trying to be as honest with myself about all of this as possible. i think my abilities to get people to like me or talk positively about me or whatever was filling the holes of inferiority i felt about myself deep down, growing up as a gay boy in the midwest who felt very incompatible with the world. i never seemed to have success in the dating world, but it didn't matter, because at least i had a lot of (shallow) friendships. my senior year of college, i had this weird realization amidst a depression i was nursing as college was coming to an end. my closest friend at school had graduated and i felt super alone on campus even though it was my senior year. at this time, i realized that i had very little interest in partying or going out to bars and clubs, which was weird because i had finally turned legal to do so. i felt super stressed in club environments with so many people and all the boring smalltalk i would feel inclined to have with the strangers around me. i wouldn't enjoy getting drunk as much anymore, and found myself spending more time alone smoking weed and making art. i'm not saying that isolating yourself and getting high nightly is always the way to go (as there are habits from this i am still working on to this day), but it was the first time in my life i would be content spending time alone, and i loved it. i felt so free to enjoy the music i wanted to enjoy, make and eat the food i wanted to eat, watch whatever tv or movies i wanted to watch, etc. and the idea of spending money to get drunk at a club with sweaty strangers, hoping that maaaaybe tonight i would meet the love of my life or my future bff, just began to seem super exhausting and, frankly, unrealistic to me. of course, i fought this, and judged myself super hard, telling myself i can't tap out of nightlife before i even graduate college. so i often forced myself to go out anyways and often found myself bored and incredibly self-conscious. all along, i've had one person from high school i would call my best friend. she lives across the country from me now but she means the world to me, and we talk most days on the phone. we went to different colleges but always stayed in touch. she and i were the same personality in high school and college, social and likable and most people (to my understanding) talked favorably about us and called us extraverts. note: these are two independent statements because i don't think \*being an extravert\* is something worth idolizing as everyone is different, but at the time i definitely conflated the two to think that being an extravert was \*better\* for the reasons i listed above. she was in greek life and had a ton of friends, she is also beautiful so many other women envied or idolized her, guys reeeeeeally wanted to fuck her. she is super humble and would never say these things so i'll say it for her :) however, after college, we went two different ways in terms of how we socialize. we both moved to (different) big cities and lived smack-dab in the middle of them. i immediately felt the same insecurity about friendship i had when i moved to my undergrad, and started frantically trying to meet as many people as possible. i eventually found a few friends i liked, but they were also very extraverted so with them i continued to live a very extraverted lifestyle for the three years i have lived in this city with them. my friend from home, on the other hand, chose to hold onto her super close friendships from high school and college and not worry so much about making a ton of new friends in her new city. this was aided as she went to the city that many of her friends from undergrad moved to, but she didn't keep in touch with most of them anyways. she has consistently had \~3 friends in her city that she tries to see, sometimes going weeks without seeing them and not worrying about that, and has found a really beautiful relationship with a man who makes her really happy. she'll go out for happy hour from time to time but has stopped hard drinking and drugs in lieu of a more introverted lifestyle. when i tell her about my social life in my city and how much it is stressing me out, she just doesn't understand why i'm forcing myself to do so much. to this day, i will frantically schedule my whole weekend starting monday, hopefully filling it by wednesday or thursday. it'll be like friday night drinks and dancing, saturday brunch, park hangout, and then party at night, sunday brunch and shopping with another friend and hopefully leaving the night open to deal with the sunday scaries. all these plans will be in my calendar by thursday. then, the weekend hits and i am so exhausted from the week that i want to cancel half the plans and chill by myself. in adulthood, i have started letting myself cancel things for my mental health, but frankly that is not nice to people who are trying to schedule their lives around me just to have me cancel plans last minute. i have felt guilty about that, but i feel even guiltier having no plans at all, because i'm worried i'm going to miss out on my life or whatever i can get from the serendipity of being at the right place at the right time out and about and not locked away in my apartment. i judge myself for needing time by myself, no matter how much time that may be, because i feel like i am disappointing my extraverted friends who cannot understand why i would need any time to myself. my best friend thinks that i am directly contributing to my anxiety by putting so much pressure on myself. but it's hard, because my whole life i have just been told i'm an extravert. i started taking the myers-briggs test in college and consistently got enfp, but today i took it again and got infp-t. and i'm sitting here wondering--what would the worst thing be if you had a smaller social life, with only people you really care about, and didn't feel such pressure to have the biggest most-popping social circle? what would it feel like to be content that you prefer spending time alone? would that make me a recluse? a loser? socially anxious? agoraphobic? or would that make me intuitive to my needs? can i still find a man if i don't force myself to go to the club every friday night? reading over all of this, it just feels silly how much i am overthinking and intellectualizing this. for one, adhd does that. but two, it is a whole confrontation with my identity. when i tell my friends i am an introvert they laugh and invalidate it, telling me that i don't understand the terminology but i must be the most extraverted person they've ever met. they'll bring up the amount of people i wave to on the street while i'm with them, but what they don't understand is that while i have those people to wave to, those friendships are shallow and limited to just waving at each other or exchanging smalltalk whenever we run into each other. they're not fulfilling relationships. i've held jobs in service positions where my role was to smalltalk with customers. but that's easy because it's shallow and repetitive smalltalk you can repeat with each person over and over. i get so anxious when i'm out and about and there's people around me because it takes so much energy to get the courage to approach them and i judge myself that i find it hard at all. because an extravert wouldn't find that hard to talk to new people. so maybe, just maybe, i've been an introvert my whole life and been ashamed of it, thus overcompensating by oversocializing and focusing on how many friends i have rather than how deep those friendships are. i love my best friend from high school, but i can't be friends with hundreds of people and expect all those friendships to feel like that friendship. nor would i want that because then it wouldn't be special. has anyone had a similar experience of discovering they were introverted after a lifetime

qi1gi6,running,"hi everyone! new member here! :). long read :( i'm an asian 23f soon to be 24. a little back story, i've always been the shy, quiet, introverted, normal girl but that all changed junior year of high school after getting bullied for being the shy, quiet and introverted girl lol. a group of kids just got a kick out of how i would react when being put on the spot and they realized if they stared at me long enough throughout class i would become flustered. i blushed easily so what was my solution to that? a lot of make up. i looked like an actual clown. i cringe about it to this day but in my 16 year old head i thought i would rather get made fun of for how much foundation i had than people seeing me turn into a tomato. so that's how my social anxiety happened. i didn't like attention, i didn't like eye contact, i didn't like interacting with anyone for fear of them judging me and witnessing an embarrassing sight. this lead me to overthink everything. i resorted to safety behaviors which meant staying home most of the time but it got bit better when i was 19 years old. my aunt had this store that she needed help running and because she spoke very limited english she pulled my ass in to help. i thought it was a one week thing but i ended up staying there for 4 years. the first year was brutal but as the years went by these interactions came a lot easier. during this time i was able to get my first job as a barista/cashier and get my drivers license. two things i never thought i would be able to do. i worked at a boba shop and it wasn't busy so it was easier to manage and the place was close by so driving there was also okay (i also have driving anxiety...). a year went by and i decided to quit and add to my resume after my cousin referred me to work as a front desk receptionist at an optometrist office. that was probably the worst decision of my life. the work environment was extremely toxic. the people that ran the office micromanaged everything, evaluated you on everything. spoke condescendingly to you and made you feel incompetent...it was hell. i wanted to quite but for my cousin's sake, i didn't want to make him look bad. i was there for about 5 months when the pandemic happened. it was a blessing in disguise for me because it meant a break from all that. i was preparing myself to go back in after a few weeks but it spanned 5 months. i knew they would call me in eventually but thought of going back scared the absolute crap out of me. i eventually got the call and after two weeks of being there i put in my two weeks notice because just as i expected, i couldn't handle it. before, i was able to put up a front and tell my self to stop being a little bitch and to do what i was told to do and leave. not the best coping mechanism but it's what got me through. now, i was now holding back tears in the break room and crying while driving home after every shift. i quit and i focused on school which was still all held online at the time. i couldn't even do an online presentation for one my classes because of how bad my anxiety got. it didn't even require me to turn on the camera, just audio and i couldn't do it. the pandemic that i thought was a blessing in disguise turned out to be the opposite. i feel like from 19-22 i made progress and now i'm back at where i started but this time older and more expectations and pressure from family and society now that i graduated. i also forgot to mention that i dropped two toxic friends along the way. i only have one friend now but we have our issues too. she's understanding and i share a lot with her but...i don't get that closeness like i did with the other two friends. it's weird. i feel alone and i want to make more friends but making friends as an adult is rough and it's even harder when you don't go out and think everyone hates you lol. i actually went to see a psychiatrist yesterday because it was getting a bit much for me. a lot of ruminating thoughts and a lot of questions like, ""how the hell am i expected to live a decent life if i can't do simple things like x, y, and z?"" fear turned into anger and i really don't want to keep living like this anymore. i graduated and i need to get on with life. i need to either find a job or go back to school to pursue higher education. i haven't decided on either yet but the main thing holding me back is my social anxiety. my psychiatrist told me that exposure therapy is what i need to do. i need to embrace that rush i get and become conditioned to get use to doing things like driving, talking to people, doing things by myself, etc. i was also prescribed lexapro, and propranolol. i haven't picked them up yet but he said that these are here to hopefully help kickstart my journey but everything else is willpower and motivation. i can't say i have any of that right now but sharing all of this does help a bit.. if you got through all that, thank you. if not, i understand because this is extremely long lol. anyways, if anyone is like me and needs an online friend i'm here! my main hobbies and interests include kpop and cooking :) \~ i also have a kpop twt account if you feel more comfortable talking there\~",0,0,0,0,0.99983215,0.0001677922

qxnfwo,sea,"social anxiety saved me and heres why. (to set the stage, ive had sa slowly developing since i was in kindergarten or first grade. it went to an extreme shortly after covid began and put me on a journey that ended yesterday) obviously, social anxiety fucking sucks. it is by far the hardest experience ive been through. (experiences with love have been my other hardest experiences) so im going to explain it using a metaphor but really, its a way of thinking about all of this. long ago a demon was placed inside of me. unaware of this i went through life as anyone would. the demon slowly grew inside me, and at times would make its presence known but not often early on because it didnt have much power yet. over time it grew stronger, and by the time covid hit, it was full grown. the demon was ready to realize its only purpose in life. it launched its attack on me by grabbing me and throwing me into darkness. i did not know where i was, how i got there, or what to do. i was truly lost. now if i could see, i would see a sea of puzzle pieces that extend beyond the horizon in every direction. i was tasked with putting this puzzle together. well really more like i was forced to do this by the demon. since i had no instructions it took me a long time to figure out my task. took even longer to find the first two pieces that go together. i head to learn each piece, its shape, and i had to learn where to find pieces i need. this was long and arduous. there were multiple occasions it felt hopeless, and twice i almost gave up completely. i endured the hell i was going through and kept working on the puzzle shrouded by darkness. after an entire year, i had some pieces together and a little momentum but it still felt hopeless because i was so far from the end. i kept enduring. never gave up. i knew that i could do it. eventually i became skillful with this challenge. i started picking up momentum. the closer i got to the end, the easier it was to put the puzzle together. i got so good at it that i was able to see the puzzle pieces without using my eyes.i got to a point where it became evident that i will overcome this soon. i could sense the final stretch. the last few pieces went together in a matter of moments. within a few minutes. ah ok now whered the last piece go there it is! the puzzle was complete, and the puzzle, was me! not just me, but my true self, my personality trait that i buried deeply inside of me at a young age because i was thought to believe that it was weakness-it was this that created the demon in the first place. the demon is social anxiety. the puzzle pieces were experiences i had to reflect on in order to learn myself to finish my puzzle the finished puzzle beautifully displayed my personality trait that i considered weakness and kept buried away: hsp: highly sensitive person. you see, as a male with hsp, i always felt like i failed to be a man because of my sensitivity. the stigma america has sees a major flaw in a man that is sensitive. at a very young age i saw this trait as pure weakness so i buried it instead of dealing with it. even worse, i happen to look physically tough and attractive (i wouldnt include this if it wasnt important to my story) so i used my appearance to hide my weakness behind. it was easy but increasingly became difficult with time. so i pretended to be strong man with no sensitivity so much so i believed it myself. i had social anxiety because i never dealt with my weakness and it grew out of control. social anxiety melted my disguise away, my ego, and only left me with my weakness. this is the hell part of my social anxiety. my weakness was fully exposed and i became sensitive all the time and constantly anxious because everyone could see my weakness. strong fears of rejection. but by being forced to have my weakness exposed i had to start learning about myself to find a way to get better. i had to learn it wasnt weakness at all. social anxiety ripped me open to let my sensitive side out. for the first time i feel whole. now i can focus on healing next i will focus on developing myself with my hsp trait. btw part of the puzzle included: burn out, depression, the way my parents raised me, sensitivity",0,0,0,0,0.9999927,7.298523e-06
qz56iv,nature,"my experience with job hunting/interviewing with sa. i (22f) have had sa for as long as i can remember. i would choose to eat by myself in the library in high school. i dreaded attending birthday parties or dances. i never talked in class unless i absolutely had to. because of my avoidant nature due to my social anxiety, i never developed my social skills to the point where i was comfortable being around other people besides family. in college, i worked a part time job where i didn't have to interact with anyone, which i absolutely loved. when i graduated may of this year, i was too comfortable in that job to look for another. my job was easy and low-stress, and i liked the down time i had to read and write on the job. it paid $12/hr so the only downside was that i wasn't able to save as much as i wanted. my family urged me to get a better paying job now that i had a degree, so a few months after graduating i began to apply for jobs related to my degree. a few days later, i got an email saying a company wanted to interview with me. i felt sick to my stomach once the excitement wore off. i had gotten comfortable not interacting with anyone due to covid and the nature of my job, and the thought of an interview was almost too nerve-wracking to bear. to try to lessen my nerves, i practiced mock-interviews over and over by myself (i was too embarrassed to ask anyone to help me). when the day of the interview came, i was a nervous wreck. my hands were shaking and i was sweating all over. the interview itself went just as bad as i feared. because i was so anxious, my mind went blank when i was asked a question, so my answers weren't well thought-out or cohesive at all. one question in particular caught me off guard and had me stuttering an answer that was literally gibberish. i said, ""sorry, i'm a bit nervous"" right after, but i could tell the interviewers were put off by my lack of social skills. needless to say, i didn't get the job. after the interview was over, i went home and cried. i re-lived every cringey thing i said every night before i was able to mostly block the memory from my mind. around that same time, i had also applied for a new position at my current company, thinking the extra money would help while still looking for jobs related to my degree. after two painful interviews, the second one involving the ceo, my manager called me into his office and told me that the ceo had said i didn't have the ""skills necessary"" to do the job. i knew he was referring to my below average social skills. my manager told me this in the nicest way possible and thanked me for ""putting myself out there"", but the whole time i was listening i was fighting back tears because i was so mortified. at that point i gave up on applying. ""there will always be someone better than me,"" i told myself. ""there isn't any point."" the rejections had taken a huge toll on my mental health. i felt worthless and depressed. even my current job was ruined because it made me feel like a failure who was too inept to work anywhere else. a month later when i had mostly blocked the traumatizing interviews from memory, i somehow found the courage to apply to a few more jobs. i landed another interview and it went a little better than before. i managed to answer all the questions more coherently. i wasn't as cringey, i thought. maybe i had a shot. nope. rejected. once again, i was crushed. this cycle repeated over and over again, until i didn't even feel excited or scared or even anxious when a company wanted to interview. i just felt numb. i was so used to rejection, i was anticipating it before the interview even started. i've always hated when people said things along the lines of, ""the more you put yourself out there, the easier it gets"". the beginning when you start is so shitty and soul-crushing it makes you never want to do it ever again. and if you somehow find the courage/motivation to try again, the process repeats itself in an agonizing cycle. your mental health suffers. your self-esteem is nonexistent. you begin to hate yourself and your anxiety and can't stop thinking about how unfair it is that you drew the short stick in life. but the people that said that were right. it does get easier. **but only when i reached the point where i felt numb inside did it get easier.** because at that point i was so tired of rejection, of setting myself up to fail, that i didn't care about what the interviewers thought about me anymore. i focused on improving my own social skills. at one point, i even found the courage to make a joke during an interview, something i could have never done before. and as crazy as it sounds, eventually *i began to look forward to interviews*, because i could see my social skills improving with each one. in the end, i got a job offer, six months after graduating. maybe someone out there is going through something similar. in any case, i hope this helps even one of you. i know the experience isn't the same for everyone, but i just wanted to share mine.",0,0,0,0,0.9945363,0.0054637995

s11dzj,run,"is it just me or is it normal for people to be kind of mean to each other?. people are just mean to each other. there's a very normalized form of being mean that i keep noticing in my regular conversations with coworkers. i think i'm only really noticing it now bc i'm meeting new people for the first time in a while. people are just so judgmental of each other, like all the time. i think i might be hyperaware of it because i'm always constantly on edge about being teased or rejected or criticized in some way. i'm not one to criticize others for the dumb stuff they do and usually feel guilt for doing so unless i feel it's really warranted (usually because of arrogance or apathy). it's bc i can totally see myself doing any one of those dumb things. when i hear people around me tease others or criticize others, i really feel a pit in my stomach. and i want to push away. i think *if they saw me do those things, they would judge me too, right?* the result is that i'm finding now that i'll push a lot of people away because i'll see how they occasionally speak of others and fear them seeing me the same way. nightmarishly, it feels like most people i meet or most people in my life are like this. i think it's normal for people to be somewhat judgmental of others. sometimes i wonder if i'm just being naive? i don't want to hold everyone to this standard of being a 100% perfect unjudgmental person? i've been judgmental of others before when they didn't deserve it, no doubt. am i just trying to find people that will be extremely safe because of my anxiety, not because i think there's something morally wrong about being critical of others? i can never be sure. i think the solution right now is to just start to operate more in line with my values, to not give in to the desire to take part in making fun of others or gossiping critically just so i can be part of a conversation. like live true to how i wish to conduct myself so i feel at peace with me. but what if i'm being too harsh about what is just normal teasing? what if my brain is way oversimplifying the bad compared to all the good i've heard these people say? i actually can't tell! i can't trust my instinct because i'm run by anxiety! what if it's normal but my overactive anxiety brain sees it as mean? i really have no clarity on this at all.",0,0,0,0,0.9999956,4.468025e-06

4gpbsy,run,"you are not your inner critic.. hey everyone. i wrote this a while ago to cope with some real life issues and stumbled upon it recently. i thought this sub might like it. there is an inner critic behind each thought and each word typed out in front of me. none of my writing has to make any sense to anyone but me, but its as if its in my nature to have it make sense for others as well. words are just used to express feelings and thoughts that i have in order to relate to another individual with similar experiences. and so other people also have thoughts and feelings that they try to convey through their words, but i wonder how often those thoughts and feelings get mixed up or portrayed inaccurately when theyre trying to convey something. maybe we all have difficulties expressing who we really are deep down. our inner most self is rarely seen by others. if we can pull down the curtain for others to see our true self we will not hesitate to do it. there must be some circumstances in place to do so. first off you must trust in that other individual completely. if you cant open yourself up to another persons opinions then you will not be able to convey your inner most self to others. you must trust that you can handle whatever another person throws at you. other people are unpredictable and thats flawed other people are good deep down, but their thoughts and feelings can also be misconstrued like ours. we see the thoughts behind our actions, but rarely do we see others for their thoughts. their actions are much more easily seen. their actions are instantly seen and judged rather than pondered like they should be. everyone is trying to deal with their own demons and we are no different. the struggles of humanity come from the same seed of despair. we are all struggling with the purpose of our existence. some seek refuge in faith, while others escape to different worlds through books or video games. there are no surefire ways to live our lives in this world. we are all given this opportunity through the sheer coincidence that the universe has created for us. there is no tangible thing that will bring us the peace that we seek. that peace can be found within ourselves and through the bonds that we forge as we live on. the people around us are also suffering, so we might as well take solace in the idea that we are not alone in our suffering. our scars may look different on the outside, but they all harbor the same feelings of sadness and despair. these feelings pave way to the love that exists only when were vulnerable with one another. its no secret that we wont be on this earth forever. why waste time judging others for their misdeeds or interests when you could be enjoying life? its a pity, really. were all so engrossed in ourselves that we rarely see others for who they really are. theyre all like me. they all have loved ones. they all would love to make a friend who they can spend time with. they all want something to believe in. as im typing this, other people are also living their lives in their own worlds. my world may be different from theirs, but each world is valid in its own right. i dont need to fear the criticism of other people. that brain power can be spent on solving my problems, rather than exacerbating them. the biggest hurdle in my 20 years of being on this earth so far is challenging that inner critic that tells me what i should be. it tells me what i shouldnt do more often than not. it tells me im not good enough to stand amongst my peers and be myself. that inner critic is as real as me, but it doesnt have to be if i loosen its grip on me. when i run that inner critic comes out and realizes it has no power. it keeps saying i cant do it. i should just give up. i dont like this pain. after a while that voice realizes the futility in its words. overcoming that voice in one area of life shows just how it can be achieved in all other areas. persistent effort is the key to any positive change. it takes more than a few words of encouragement to get past this inner critic. it takes determination and it takes time. nothing happens instantly. no real change can be done in a day. habits form and within those habits are the key to a good life.",1,1,1,0,0.9999962,3.7947368e-06

5i0sxd,"walk, running, jog","reducing your social anxiety. i wanted to put this together to help as many people as possible that are trying to function with social anxiety, which as you already know, can be extremely hard. i also want to say that in no way, shape, or form have i defeated social anxiety. these are tips, advice, and helpful things that can and will improve your quality of life and diminish your social anxiety. most of this comes from my own experiences and also from what people have said about their own experiences in reducing/overcoming social anxiety. these will not only improve your anxiety but also your life in general. stop masturbating and stop watching porn(if you do): a big reason for a lot of people's social anxiety is masturbation and porn. i won't get into the specifics too much but a orgasm from porn triggers a neurotransmitter to go off in your brain in a very large amount called dopamine. such a large amount and especially at a high rate(if you orgasm to porn a lot) can cause anxiety, depression, among other things. stopping this alone can do so many things. able to talk to girls better, more energy, and being relaxed in social situations are all benefits of stopping this. also if you are addicted to porn and masturbation(which might be you) this may be harder then usual. for most people that are addicted, full benefits are usually seen about 90-110 days after stopping. this is the time is takes to rewire your brain. also the time may vary depending on the severity of your addiction. healthy diet: stay away from sugars. to be a healthy person, doctors say we should only have 37g of sugars a day. to put that in perspective a regular pack of skittles has 46g of sugar. an excess amount of sugar also triggers the dopamine transmitter which as you know, can do bad things. stay away from sugar as much as possible. it is not good for you in any way. try going after healthier things which can have great effect on your mood and anxiety. cold showers: not only do cold showers build willpower, they also are proven to decrease depression and build testosterone, which can help your anxiety tons. cold showers are also very refreshing and can provide you with much more energy. the next chance you get, take a cold shower(not a cool shower) and see how you feel afterwards. i honestly didn't know what to expect but when getting up for school or work, they can take the grogginess away and you'll feel much more capable of tackling the challenges the day presents. limiting time spent on phone/tv: so much of us with social anxiety get caught into this lifestyle where we're always on our phones, games, tv. don't get trapped into this lifestyle. do activities and build hobbies that you will enjoy. start reading a novel. start playing a sport. do something other then coming home from work or school everyday and going straight to the tv. exposure to social interactions: some of us hide away or avoid social interactions or things that give us anxiety. one of the best ways to become more comfortable and relaxed when in these social situations that you dread is by doing them. build your confidence and experience in these situations. greater anxiety in the present is less anxiety in the future. i'll tell you how i am currently doing some of these things. 1. my job: i got a job at monkey joes. if you don't know what that is, it's a inflatable place where kids and families can come to jump around and have birthday parties/gatherings. part of my job is hosting parties. which means in front of 16-60 people i have to host a party. also this party is in somewhat a enclosed room where most of the time people are standing/sitting right next to eachother. i have to give out orders, make sure the mom and dad of the birthday boy/girl are satisfied, help with anything that needs to be done. also i have to speak in front of all these people and let them know what to do. my first party, i was terrified. i've now down about 5-6 and guys, i can't even put into words the difference this has already had on me. this helped me in so many ways like being in big groups, walking into places(like classrooms) with a lot of people and so forth. it's amazing the difference something can make when all you have to do is just simply apply yourself. school: as much as i can, i try to ask questions, and start conversations. i've made so many friends this year that i wouldn't have imagined making a year ago. try to ask questions and talk to people your interested in talking too. join a toastmasters club(when you are ready): a toastmasters club is a group of people who meet up and give speeches to each other to better their skills at public speaking. this is a great way to challenge yourself and anxiety. it's also a great way to become a better public speaker which is a good skill to have. running/working out: not only does this get you in better shape but running or working out can build testosterone and also release a lot of built up anxiety. as you know, testosterone is good for people with anxiety. it can build confidence. if i've had a stressful day or have a lot of anxiety, i'll go on a 30min-hour jog with music and feel tons better afterwards. drugs: stop smoking weed: i used to smoke weed a lot. i think it actually had to do something with causing my social anxiety. i stopped smoking weed and felt loads better in the future. thc is linked to causing social anxiety so watch out for that. not only did this help my anxiety but i was also able to focus on my school and sports much more. my focus in the classroom was also improved. meditation: i, personally, have not tried meditation before. as you've probably heard though, it can do some pretty good things. people have said it's worked wonders in their life. look up good techniques and try them. also, if you do meditate, feel free to comment on your techniques and some benefits meditation has. be prepared: when in school, knowing what the class is about or what the discussion is about gives me way more confidence then if i don't know what anything is about and i'm clueless. i've found that when i'm actively doing my homework, studying for tests, and maintaining a high grade, i have less anxiety/more confidence in the class and also around my peers. don't just do the work or get by with a d. become actively engaged in what's being taught and you will find yourself very intrigued and applying yourself more. limit stress: sometimes, life is very overwhelming. try to get things done beforehand and create a schedule of events/things that need to be done. you already have anxiety as it is, don't stress yourself out even more with things that need to be done. get things done ahead

5l9a79,"walk, sun","""she'd rather stay alone."". i am visiting a german host family i used to live with. i don't know why i thought three weeks would be an appropriate amount of time spent here. in retrospect, one day would have been plenty. anyway today, the family are having two get-togethers. right now (lunch), they have the mother's parents over. in total, there are six people: father, mother, son, brother of mother, mother of mother, father of mother. later (dinner) there will be some other people, i believe again there will be a total of six people who will stay for a second christmas and until new year's. anyway so as per usual, i'm alone in bed still. i've decided to spend the day doing positive things to keep my mood up as i usually get really depressed during celebrations, and i know tonight at midnight will be rough. so i'm writing on my journal now (while redditing), daydreaming about positive things, i will later continue to plan a project i'm doing, read a book i am absolutely in love with, eat the best food in the neighbourhood and stuff my face, go on a walk when the sun goes down and brace myself for midnight. but anyway as they were about to eat lunch, the father asks me ""would you like to join us? it's totally okay if you say no."" and so i tell him ""i would rather be alone."" in my most apologetic voice. i know the father and the mother are used to my antics. i lived with them for a year, and barely saw them. they know i have social anxiety and have come to accept and respect it. i still feel bad whenever i decline spending time with them but six people, three of which i am not really used to? too much. arg i'm tearing up just thinking about it. anyway. so as he leaves, he announces to the others ""she would rather be left alone!"" and then closes the kitchen/livingroom door. i feel so damn embarrassed and annoyed at myself. it's like i've actually failed them, and they're getting annoyed at me as well. part of me wants to leave early because now it's just ridiculous. i've been here for 11 days and have spent the last four or so in bed all day, sneaking out to eat, shower or brush my teeth only when they're away or too busy/loud to hear me. i hate myself. i truly do right now.",1,1,1,1,1.5867339e-06,0.99999845

79e4q8,"walk, outside","story of me beating social anxiety!!. warning: this is going to be a long post. hello, i just joined this sub reddit and created this account just for the sake of getting my social life back in control. before i go any further i would love to talk about where i was 4 years ago. since i was a kid i always wondered why i am i so weird. why can't i do social stuff like everyone else, why am i always scared, why do i stutter when i have attention of a group of people. these questions always were in my head until when day i found out about social anxiety and finally i was like i have the answer. now i can look for a solution to treat my social anxiety. i think i was like 16 when i found out about social anxiety, although i was in india at that time so didn't had much support for it plus basic teenage stuff was going on in life. getting bullied, being ashamed of being skinny which hurt my self esteem really bad, not being able to express my feeling to the girl i liked. all of this made my anxiety worse and i started to avoid people. move forward to the age of 19 i come to new york, i feel now my life is gonna change. somehow magically being in new york will turn me into some confident social bird. but i was wrong, i started college and things aren't changing i am still anxious around people have low self esteem, don't have a gf, skinny sf plus i am developing depression now. on top of that my mindset is changing into a mindset of a victim, i always feel like i am being attacked by people. this goes on for few more years and somehow i survive. now i am 21, fucked up. social anxiety is so bad that i can't even get out of house. i fucked up my semester in college and gpa is all fucked up. all i do is play league of legends whole day and i am only eating like one meal a day. plus i am broke af don't even have money for food. i had it enough i said i have to change myself and will have to take control over my life. i had this burning feeling inside my body which i couldn't get rid of. so i started to taking, i did the following: 1. for first month i practiced getting out of house. i would go carts thinking about how do i get out of house. but i committed to it sometimes i would just walk outside for a minute and comeback. 2. second month started to take walk outside house. my goal was to take walk a in places with lots of people, which is easy to do since i live in nyc. while walking my goal was to observe my anxious thoughts and try not to react to it. i read this book called power of now, where i learned about this concept of observing your thoughts. 3. next i got a job as a salesperson. holy shit that was a nightmare i have no idea how i even survived that, it was just crazy i wasn't event able to talk yo customers. i wanted to avoid that but i had no choice. 4. in college my goal was to ask questions in class. it was awkward though but i had made up my mind. i am not going to live like this, i have to beat this social anxiety. now fast forward to 2017, one of my best years in life man. 1.i crushed it this year, i started my ecommerce business for which i worked my ass off and now i am making decent money. i am also about to launch my own social media agency. plus i am part to so many entrepreneurial communities on social media. 2. last semester i had one class where i would i was the most social person. everyone knew me, i would make jokes and stuff. 3. i joined gym and went from 115lb skinny dude to 140 lb guy although i haven't been going regularly to gym recently. 4. went to tony robbins event unleash the power within! it was really crazy crazy. i am really into self development and tony is one my favorite person i look upto. 5. i went on a trip. 6. i tried to pickup girls, lol. it's fun but it's scary at times. and more stuff which will only make this post longer. how did i do it? i really believe that what we focus on is what we become. so my whole life i focused on social anxiety but in last few years i have changed my focus from anxiety, depression to the person i want to become. i try to focus more on what my goal is and how can i achieve it. also i feel you have to have a sense of like enough is enough. frustration and anger have always been my fuel, they give me so much energy to push myself further and further. do i get anxiety? yes feel it everyday it's just matter of taking control over it. decide if you want to give in to anxiety or you want to win over it. also i recently read something cool about anxiety, instead of trying to call yourself being anxious call yourself as being excited as anxiety and excitement are similar emotions. so by doing this whole meaning changes. although i haven't been doing things i used to do and getting kind of comfortable. recently i started to stutter when asking questions in front of big group so i have start working on social skills again. ask me anything guys. you want to message, do that. i will do anything to help you need any advice. i am here to grow and help others grow. peace",1,1,1,1,1.2960863e-06,0.9999987

bmrze1,"outside, walk, basketball","how i got rid of my social anxiety (not a panacea, but things that helped me). first of all, i know this post is long, bear with me. im writing this post to be the message i wish i couldve read 2 years ago. if i had understood then what i understand now, i couldve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. i hope his helps someone out there. even if your experience is somewhat different, i guarantee there is something in what ive been through that might help make sense of it all. **tldr**: i went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. at that point, i did everything i could to figure out what went wrong, and how i could fix this terrible problem. the two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/netflix/reddit/youtube, and increasing isolation from other people. **how my social anxiety developed** a little background about my life. when i was young, basically up until high school, i never had a problem with anxiety. i spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. im 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. i think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than i had. internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and i imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years. i started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. i had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didnt spend much time with them outside of school. at the end of the day i would usually go home and spend time on reddit, youtube, netflix or watch pirated movies and tv shows. my family had some serious problems, so i didnt like to spend time with them. i would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. my family was pretty poor, so id be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. i spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers. i went off to college and everything turned around for me. i was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and i became good friends with many of them. i made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and i had social interaction every day. it became so easy for me to spend time with people. i was the happiest id ever been, and figured id grown from my awkward high school days and i was cured. i didnt realize it could ever be like that again. my senior year things became worse for me than theyd ever been. im not proud of how i responded to a difficult year, but i honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. i was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job i hated. i had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. i became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so i started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work i had to get done. i started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. i became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. when i started missing assignments and classes, i avoided my friends so i wouldnt have to explain. my mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. i numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. i would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. i would constantly be thinking about how i was missing work, letting down my family and friends. i didnt want to open up to anyone. i was incredibly ashamed. i ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades werent out yet, and just lied to family and friends. i told no one that i had failed, just held it inside. i moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where i figured i could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. its been just about a year now since i failed, and im going back in the fall to finish. **symptoms of social anxiety, how it played out in my life** once i moved back home, i took a job where i had infrequent social interaction, and i spent very little time with my family. problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. i would feel anxious when people walked up to me, i would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. in conversations, i would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. i almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. and thats not me being too harsh on myself; ive spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, i understand how i was coming across, i just couldnt figure out how to be socially comfortable again. i was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. this was very embarrassing for me. i became uncomfortable just being with other people, so i isolated myself more. every day just kind of sucked, i was always worrying about how i came across to others, always worried in general. i became very depressed and lonely. started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so i saw them very infrequently. **how i got rid of the anxiety, became socially comfortable again** a big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how i was spending my time. i started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what i was doing. then at the end of the week, id review how the week had been, what areas i needed to focus on, what mistakes i kept making. at the end of the month, id do the same process. i started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere i went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that i wanted to be sure to remember later. i wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. i recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress. i stopped compulsively using my phone, and i cut back the time i was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. all the time i would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span. i found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when i was younger. this was a real problem for me my senior year, and i am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. all that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. i am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, reddit and youtube in particular, was having an adverse affect on my mind. it was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. i started a habit of meditation every day. essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. i cant overstate how important this has been to me. it is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where i can relax, dont have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. i use the waking up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. if you cant afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator sam harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. i started spending more time with people who i loved, who wouldnt judge me. this is the most important part. i was always anxious to talk with people, because i wasnt doing it very often. and when i did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didnt know me, so if i came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. my mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but i knew i needed more social interaction, so i made the drive, over and over. after i spent an hour or so with my good friends, i started to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything i said, etc. the key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. spend more time with friends. i was lucky in that i had friends out there who loved me. i know some people dont have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. dont give up. i started stretching and exercising every day. for me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. obviously exercise alone wont fix all your problems. for more information on depression i recommend the book lost connections by johann hari. it helped me a ton. or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on joe rogan or sam harris podcast. exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. after going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. mind and body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little. i started eating more healthy food. i switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. i figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. im not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant i had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time. **tips for social interaction** when i started spending more time with people, i was very rusty. i felt as if i had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. here are a few things i find helpful to keep in mind. eye contact. i made so many mistakes when i was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. so it is important. where you look says a lot. in general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message i am listening to you, im interested in what youre saying, you are heard. one mistake i was making was i would think alright, be friendly, make eye contact. but i would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, i would think about it too much, i would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact i wouldnt even process what they said. so id give off a message thats very off, too intense, and if i wasnt listening to what was said i had to look away and kind of process after the fact. you basically want to get to a point where you arent thinking about eye contact. thats only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to aplace where it doesnt make you uncomfortable, and you can just use your eyes to convey meaning. as a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person thats talking to you. you dont have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so youre not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. you want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. you dont have to force eye contact. if you arent too comfortable with it, thats alright. as long as you pay full attention to whats being said, youre alright. if you come off a little shy because youre not making a lot of eye contact, thats ok. it gets easier the more time you spend with people. for an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. people tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. theres not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you. what to say. a lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. part of that was i was wasting so much time online, i really didnt have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. in any case, its always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other persons interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. when you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. again, the more you do it the easier it gets. ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. for example, if they keep bringing up basketball, take note of that. ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. or talk about

bn4clt,"run, outside","im wasting my time. i just really need to vent this, my head is about to explode full of stress, but i just look at things and i worry why i cant be normal and cant dig myself out of loneliness. just a heads up, its gonna be a long one if you are on mobile. and; i wanna give some background, i live in the uk, sometimes i feel like this place is alien to me, even though for the 18 years ive been on this earth, ive lived here. i felt like i've never truly fitted with people, i dont think i'm an odd person, just my mental health is so poor, its comes off like that. parents always called me a shy kid (i was quieter but i think i'm naturally a more chill person), i don't think that really helped my situation, because i wasn't suffering from it then, i remember still being able to be normal in public up until around the age of 13. i have faced a lot of bullying in my life, sometimes from my own family without them knowing it,up until the age of 16, maybe not to the extent of what other people have faced, but it seemed to affect me a lot more. i will say that anxiety does run in my family, so i believe it is partially down to genetics. and; right, i wanna cut deep into the bullying, i wanna start with my family, obviously i know families have a bit of it, its just natural, but i feel like they instilled fear into me for stuff that did not need it. for example, i still get anxiety from listening to certain types of music in my house incase someone hears it and says something about it, i remember one time, when i had my first phone (i had one before but my parents kept taking it off of me), there were music ringtones on there, i couldnt possibly remove them, they were system locked, my dad finds them one day on my phone, plays them and everyone in the house laughs at me. or another example, which has hit me the hardest of them all, social media, they scared me into not getting, made me fear it cus i was too young for it, i might agree, but they made me avoid it like the plague, until 16, when i got facebook and instagram finally (i had twitter at 13, buts its not really that kind of place, but i still cant bring myself to add my family on there let alone most people i know. in other forms of bullying, when i say i am not an odd person, well i definitely used to be, up until i started college, i was very weird, and was bullied to death in school, people would play 'punchies' on me just for fun, and well, me being a skinny kid, i couldnt really fight back with conviction. i admit, im an emotional guy, and that i ruined a lot of friendships for me, cus if one thing went wrong, id storm off, at least these days im able to battle off that emotion. i was made fun out of in every single way possible, and its beaten every single last ounce of confidence and self esteem i have had. and; to put this into perspective, this is how bad my problems go to; i cant go outside without feeling a strong urge of anxiety, i cant add anyone on social media, even if i know them cus i dont trust anyone and im afraid they will also reject me, they have to add me, which of course, no one will because no one cares (honestly, i feel like i just really hate my area), so ive ended up with only like 30 friends on facebook, similar number on insta, i do have snap, but i think you dont really gotta add everyone on there, since its more of a private place. i feel really incompetent at doing anything by myself, i feel like i have to do stuff for a strong reason otherwise i flake. my anxiety out in public goes near panic attack levels, i wouldn't say i go to that, but i sometimes ill get a dry mouth and body just doesnt want to deal with the pressure, i also cant move my body normal unless i'm confident, which is a more weird quirk thats been given to me by social anxiety. i never had a girlfriend, never even had a first kiss, never even attempted to really chat up a girl, i feel like im gonna end up as one of those people who is in his mid 20s, and still in that situation. i dont even like people looking at my phone, i refuse to pull it out on public transport unless its pretty empty. and; i feel so isolated all the time, my phone is constantly dry, i have tried some positive things, like meeting people online in various ways, a lot of those people i really like too. i've really tried to keep positive this week, but today its just went haywire, i woke up with a real big feeling of loneliness, i just felt the need to cry, i didn't know why, and now its just making me think about stuff too deeply.",1,1,1,0,0.998262,0.001738036

(she convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. which, it was, but not all like she thought. this was also good advice from her point of view because i had a lot in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. so leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) i was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me i stop loving her. she deserved someone better, so i made that choice for her. i wanted to be better. i wanted to be someone she deserved. so i started trying to be a person. i went and got a real hairstyle (i use to just use clippers and do it myself.) i started running/biking again. (i have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) i got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. i went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and i just wore running/work out attire. i enrolled in school, which is something i stopped when i went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. in school i started strong, i was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so i could get connections for an internship. then my anxiety hit me, hard. i couldn't finish my resume because i am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. i lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. that caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. my 4 a's fell to near f's and i was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate i knew from an old job and rounded my grades to c's before the end. even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. nothing changed. no one cared. i ended things last november with her. i was motivated to better myself until april. i went to the gym every other day, i ate healthy, i wasn't excited to be back in school, but i did it and took pride in doing so. but the pride in myself diminished to nothing. i still had no one to go have fun with. no one texted how i was doing. i even stopped getting likes/conversations on tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. i am lonelier more than ever, and i have been without close people most of my life. i use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. or teach people english (which is something that brought me joy.) now the only connection i feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes i get on something. i use to be a lurker and only send messages when i saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. i would just tell them i would be here to listen for the former case and that i appreciate them if it were the latter. i use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. it is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. since april i have basically laid in bed. i still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. i browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. i don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy i am. i don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if i am really fooling people. i don't want to be a burden so i don't talk about anything. when my brother's girlfriend asked why i wasn't leaving for classes i told her i missed the deadline to enroll because i was depressed a friend of mine passed away. really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. i would have loved to be friends with her. she was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. i was especially torn up about losing someone that i use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. she was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, i wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. why couldn't the world have taken me instead? i can't find any strength in myself. i don't know what to do.",1,1,1,0,0.9999815,1.8434837e-05

ixf77k,"soccer, tennis, basketball, soccer","could it be that i never noticed i had social anxiety, or is it just a temporary phase that'll go away once i figure what i want to do in life career wize?. i've never been a huge social person, but i've always had my 3-4 group of friends at each school i went to. i think primary school was the only place i didn't have friends for one year, but even then, i never felt like i cared. i didn't like group project but i didn't mind them because i usually did them with a friend, and while i was of course nervous in front of people, i didn't feel overwhelmed. i also didn't feel overwhelmed when i had to present something at the board by myself, i didn't like it but i forced myself and it went okay you know. i never spoke up in class unless needed. all my teachers said it, ""too calm"" ""doesn't participate"" but because i don't talk unless i have something to say. &amp;; i never knew what i wanted to do career wise, never. but i also didn't ask myself much. i made jokes and appeared chill, which alot of people told me. it was the whole vibe i gave, and i felt like it too, meaning i didn't feel stressed or anxious much. only time i felt somewhat stressed were for first days of schools, when i moved somewhere else, nervously hoping i would make friend, that i wouldn't get lost, but it feels like it's just common stress you know. after high school, i went to uni because all my friends did and i was good in english so i figured why not. ended up not being my thing. i failed. that's not when the stress started. i then applied to psychology at uni and to a pa course. i didn't even know it was for pa but the diploma seemed pretty basic and quick (2 years), so i went for this one, even though i had psychology in the back of my head for years, because i got scared of how long psychology was. i got scared i wouldn't be good at it. i got scared i wouldn't get good grades. i had to do 3 short interships for the pa course, and i felt anxious through all of them but i managed. i hate calling and answering phone calls but i had to do it for most of my interships and i managed. mostly because i could pass them to employees who knew the answers to the questions asked. but i wasn't very social, and i've been told so. i didn't really go out of my way to talk to the employees. when i finished the pa course and got my diploma. i realized along the way it wasn't my thing either. i don't want to be a pa. and that's when the stress started. i got a small part time job because i know myself and, having not worked alot, i knew i had to go slowly. i did. but it was a job at a pizza place and it also made me realize i have no freaking idea what i want to do. and even if i did, i'm so freaked out now, having spent so much time at home with my mind, that i would be scared as hell to go for it. &amp;; my dog died after my diploma, and he was my best friend, i know everyone says this, but as someone who didn't have real friends beside one who stayed, he really was. i was 7 when we adopted him, he died when i was 23. he was my shadow in a funny way, wouldn't leave my side, and i don't know if this is related. i never kept much contact with all the people i met in schools, only one friend or so. and i don't know if the way i've felt scared of the future, scared of jobs, scared of everything, came because of my dog's death as a way to mourn, or if it's deeper than that. i don't know if it's covid, because i don't feel like i feel anxious about covid, living in a small village, but then maybe i don't see how anxious it makes me. and i don't know if it's just not knowing what i want to do in life. or if it's all of them. i should be focusing on my driving license but yet i can't. it goes to the point where i cry at night quietly so my sister don't hear through the wall. my heart races fast most of the time, my feet fidget most of the time, i'm constantly thinking about career, career, career. but i'm incapable, or i feel so at least, of doing anything. i feel like i'm scared of going out of my comfort zone, of meeting people, of going outside, of having responsabilities when i feel so immature. i don't want a job, but i have to no? i remember having a fear of my parents dying at something like 11 years old. but it passed and i got over it, yet right now it's back again but it's worse because i'm older and they're older and i haven't figured shit out yet. when my mom took me to soccer, tennis, basketball and all that; i had no problem with it. but now that i had the idea of starting soccer again, i felt so scared and anxious of calling by myself like an adult that i just didn't do it? i wanted to learn piano recently, never called. i got so anxious when i got phone calls for jobs, or for interviews, i literally had to write what i was gonna say on my phone? i never cared about phones calls younger, so why? when i started the pa course, i didn't freak out this much at the aspect of going to a new school in a place i knew nothing about, so why didn't i go for psychology this year because i got scared of going back to school again? it's just so frustrating. i guess i'm posting again here, because i don't know who else to tell. what if i'm just making up those feelings all in my head? what if i'm just being a crybaby when so many people have it worse. i know we shouldn't compare, but i feel like ""what if i'm overexagerating my feelings and i'm not actually anxious/nervous but i made it all up in my head and convinced myself i was while some people actually suffer from it?"" i feel anxious, i feel incapable or having responsabilities, immature, i feel scared. but am i?

qf2uhn,"outside , soccer, soccer","i am doing an exchange year but my social anxiety is making my mental health here pretty bad and i kind of regret my decision.... hi:) ok, so this is probably gonna be a very long post.. sorry about that. so i (16f) am from germany but i am currently doing an exchange year in texas and going to a high school here. i've always struggled with social anxiety and it has always made my life a little bit harder. but overall and especially since acknowledging it i was able to get along with it fine. and although i struggled with my friends situation in germany too, i was at a point where i was pretty comfortable. i had 3 close friends (although 1 maybe not as much anymore and i only very regularly met up with one of them), i felt comfortable in school and in my class since i had been in the same class with the same people for 5 years, i had a good relationship with my parents and siblings (although looking back now i definitely didnt appreciate and acknowledge them enough) and i was just overall doing ok i guess. so i always wanted to do an exchange year and decided to actually do it and go to school in the us for 10 months. i was really excited about it and thought going specifically to the us would help me get more open and overcome my social anxiety since the people here are known for being very open. i thought about it a lot and imagined how my life here would be. everyone i ever heard of told me that doing an exchange year was the best decision and one if not the best year of their lives. so i felt encouraged and i felt confident i could do it. i knew that this would be a very big challenge for my social anxiety but since my english was already very good and i was basically already fluent i decided that would make it one challenge less and i would be able to jump over my shadow and do this. well i have been here for 3 months now and it is just so much harder than i ever could have imagined, i cry myself to sleep a lot and my mental health overall and my social anxiety is just much worse than it was at home. i live in a host family here and i do get along with them pretty well in general and besides the fact that living with a family you never knew before, of course, is very weird i would say i have gotten used to living here, and rather comfortable. the only thing giving me a lot of issues here are the kids. the little girl is just not respecting my boundaries at all and tries to hug me every time she gets the chance to, even though and because she knows that i do not like hugs and they make me uncomfortable. that's just one thing but i'm not really gonna get into the other reasons here. so as i said i am a senior at a high school here. so as you might imagine i don't really have any friends. the only friend group that i have here are the other exchange students but that is just a little bit different because we're going through the same thing of course and i didn't really have to do anything myself to get these friends yk and a lot actually like went through my host sister (i have a double placement which means there is another exchange student living in my house and without her i probably would not survive this here at all (the kids and just everything in general). i don't really have any classes with them though besides one class i have with my host sister. in this class, we have 2 friends but as you might imagine i wasn't the one that like initiated that and we don't meet them like outside of school. i don't have any friends in any of my other classes because i am just mentally (it feels like it's physically) not able to take the first step and start talking to people and then keeping it going. before coming here i kind of thought everyone would know i'm not from here and be interested in talking to me, which is pretty naive to think but that's what i heard from some former exchange students. well, my school here is huge (2770 students, for comparison my german school roughly has 600) and no one is interested in talking to me. and if they are then they ask like 2 questions and then they're not interested anymore. and i guess my accent also is not strong enough for people to know i'm not from here. also, they are probably used to people not speaking perfect english since we have a lot of students coming from mexico at my school that only speak spanish and a little bit of english. our school has a and b days and 4 classes per day. a day is the day where i have forensic science with my host sister which makes it an ok day but still in the other classes i pretty much just quietly does my work alone. well, b-day is way worse i quietly do my work the whole day since i don't have any friends or people talking to me on that day. i also have my less favorite classes on b-day. so i just kind of exist and get through with these school days but i never really have fun in school. and i mean i came here to experience the american high school so it makes me feel so bad and guilty and like i'm wasting time and i'm just not really happy in school here. most exchange students say to join a club or a sport and that that will make it very easy to find friends, so since i already played a little bit of soccer in germany i joined the soccer team. sadly that didn't help me either and it just kind of feels a little awkward a lot of the time. this whole thing is just being really bad for my mental health, i cry a looot here and i'm just not really that happy here and i just want to be home so often. i have friends that are doing an exchange year as well and seeing all their stories and talking to them and hearing about how happy they are here and how ist the best year of their lives and they don't want to leave and just only see them having like a lot of friends just hurts e a lot and makes me feel so bad. i've already unfollowed every exchange student i am not personally friends with but it is still very hard. one of my best friends (the one i meet more often) is doing an exchange year as well and she is the only one i ever really open up to about my social anxiety since she also has an anxiety disorder and can relate a lot better and i don't know why but she is just the only one i feel comfortable talking to about my struggles. so for her ist pretty much the opposite and her mental health got so much better being here and hearing from her just hurts so much too. and she tries to help me but i just feel like right now i have no one that can relate to me and really understand me and i'm just t not really a person that opens up easily which means i'm not really comfortable opening up to anyone. and now my birthday is in like 2 weeks and i just don't know how i'm supposed to be able to feel happy on my birthday in this situation when it's gonna be my first birthday ever without my family and also without my twin sister who is doing an exchange year as well (which makes me compare mine to hers as well too of course and it's really hard to see her be so happy too). and of course, i'm happy for all my friends and that they are having such an amazing time but i am just not and that makes it so difficult for me to feel happy for them. i just don't know what to do anymore and how i'm supposed to make it through the next 7 months. and don't get me wrong of course there are still happy moments here like when i'm hanging out with the other exchange students but otherwise i just kind of regret my exchange year a little bit. and also every you do have a local coordinator from the agency that is supposed to talk to you regularly and just help you with things but mine is just not that present. technically she is supposed to talk to us like once every 2 weeks and meet us at least once a month but i have only seen and talked to my local coordinator once for like 10 minutes after the first month. she was also supposed to give us an orientation where she goes over rules advice etc when we got here but she never did that either. so although she does seem like a nice person she's just so busy with her own family and her job she doesn't really do her job as a local coordinator that well and it just doesn't make me comfortable enough to talk to her about this. sorry, this was so long but i just kind of needed to rant about this and let it all out somewhere, and maybe one of you has some advice for me",2,1,2,0,0.99686784,0.0031321174

glrrso,camping,"25 with no close friendships. when i was in high school, i realized that i was always the one who pursued friendships, and that all of the people i hung out with didnt seem to reciprocate our friendship. looking back, it was upsetting to me that it seemed to me that no one actually wanted to be my friend, they just would be if it was convenient. so, basically, when i was 16, i stopped inviting my friends to do things, telling myself that if they cared about me, they would invite me to do things with them. i still had some normal social stuff in high school...a senior camping trip, a group to go to dinner with before prom...but pretty much all of my close friendships ended. most of them were good riddance...a lot of my friends has blatantly bullied me in middle school anyway. ive realized that this is a huge part of why im now 25 and terrible and social interactions. i let that mindset bleed into potential friendships in college and now as an adult too. there are tons of perfectly wonderful people i associated with in college, but very few that i was close with and none who i talk to now, mostly because i cant let myself open up and be myself. basically the only person who i consider to truly be my friend now is my fianc, who i live with. i struggle to even participate in conversations because im so self conscious, to the point where my future brother in laws girlfriend thinks i dont like her. i only talk openly or show any personality when ive had a drink or two, and then im just as likely to embarrass myself because im either tipsy or i just say shit that doesnt come out right because im not good at talking to people. ive been thinking about how i got to be this way for a while because im unhappy with the fact that i dont have friends and wanted to share this with people who might relate. thanks.",2,1,2,1,2.0568248e-06,0.999998

so that's a success hurray for me! they introduced me to a random girl they saw and became my first girlfriend, second success. not to go into details but she was my ""first"" of a lot of things...3rd success? does it count if she dumped me within a week to focus on studies?.... i like to think so... we'll call that a half success i guess? the first day of college i told myself i'll talk to the first person that catches my eye at all, it was a girl with a backpack that had a bunch of eeveelutions on it from pokemon. we talked the entire walk from the dorms to our classes. she dyed her hair red afterwards so she's not the most eye catcher of them all because i really like dyed hair and stuff... it's cool. i seen her around multiple times while hanging out friends and/or doing college stuff but i haven't had the courage to talk to her again because either she's with friends, or i'm not in the right state to talk to her without freaking out. than one day me and one of my friends go to the cafe for lunch and boom there she is talking to a friend. i start rambling to my friend the numerous reasons why i shouldn't talk to her. she has a friend. what if she's not interested? what if she's not interested in men??? it'll look weird. i ended up tricking myself into sitting next to her and talking to her until they left because they were just about to leave before i sat down, that's like what? 3.5 successes? she stayed longer to talk from what i thought. when she got up i panicked and asked ""hey we should exchange numbers so we can chat some more?"" she gave me her number and left and for the walk back to my dorm i was on top of the world........ it was fake btw. i see her everyday and it freaks me out now because of the number thing, so much that my friends warn me and give me cover ups to not confront her. is that even a helpful thing? because a part of my mind is very small and says ""m-maybe she didn't mean to."" a slightly louder voice says ""maybe there's still hope if just keep idle chit chat when you see here and wait until she asks for your number or something."" than there's a really loud screaming voice that well... screams ""you blew it!!! or you never had it to blow in the first face!!!"" today though i was in my solar system class and i saw this girl there that i found was really cute and... ok this is gonna sound weird because it's like a class thing but the way she said woden and could name all the germanic gods was impressive for me... not the saying woden thing that was a part of the cute thing. so i saw that she was right next to me walking out so i talked to her for a bit, didn't catch her name but we have the same class so it's like no rush, don't want to mess things up like with red hair... did i mention she had the same name and major as my ex gf i previously mentioned? anyways so that's another opposite gender i talked to, 4.5 success! man typing this is really helping me feel so much better about myself. so here's the part where i get down again because i have to revisit it yaaaaay~ i was walking back to my dorm when i see the divine light from the sun bounce off the fiery scarlet mane of someone in front of me. i know we'll be going the same way for almost the entire walk. so i make a quick cross of the road to be on the other side than her. that helped me but than i remembered the path we take, where now she'll cross the road soon and since i'm on the other side it'll be a direct collision instead of just me walking a few yards behind her as i would of earlier. this made me panic....i'm sounding pathetic... i hid behind this wooden fence thing that holds the dumpsters of what i assume is someone lives but it isn't a dorm, anyways i stayed there for a few minutes. calmed down breathed and drank some water. i couldn't see if she passed the meeting point yet but i was like right there but hidden, but it been a while in relevant (is that the word?) to the amount of time it would take to pass the spot. so i got up and turned and started walking back to my dorm.... if i wasn't paying attention i would of ran into her. boom the collision i wanted to avoid is now here and worse! because i hid! did she see i hid? if she saw i hid than it must look like i did so in purpose of running into her. i don't want to look like a stalker!!! i'm not a stalker! i was trying to avoid her! not run into her! why was she late to the spot! did she hid too? does she feel bad about the number? or does she already don't like me that much? it been like a solid...3 seconds of silence of me and her just walking... same pace because i tried slowing down to get behind her like what would of gone down but i got a good foot or so on her so my slow but not noticeably slow walk with my long legs is her average walk. i started talking to her just little stuff to ease the tension that i felt so much surely she felt it. she was nice to me and was helping me figure out thing involving the actual college stuff of college and than she left because her dorm building was closer than mine... and that's it... i stayed in my dorm for the rest of the day and now i'm here writing this at midnight thinking why i am writing this i got class tomorrow morning. to whoever read this far, i know there's no way i can see who actually read this and who just clicked it and said nope but thank you. sure you can just see my previous posts on other stuff and know who i am but you took the time to read my story and if you have any helpful comments or anything please i'd love to hear/read them. i also know that not just me is the one needing help in this subreddit so if you are going through the same college+social anxiety thing as i am and need someone out there who will probably never know your name and just to vent to. message me, i know how much help it is to have someone to talk to about this stuff. if this gets positive feedback i might do it again... it really helped me just to say this stuff out loud. p.s: i put the tag other because i don't know what it would fall under so if know, help a guy out.",2,1,2,0,0.9999689,3.1123902e-05

ot1kwz,waves,"major landmark victory: i no longer believe that social failure = catastrophic humiliation (well, mostly lol). for 6 months ive been working on conquering my social anxiety. i started this journey being horrified of cashiers. i was so desperate for social change in myself that i felt like every cashier interaction that didnt result in a friendship was a failure. i was scared every time i left my room because i thought my roommates were felt i was a weirdo/loser. i would leave some of my social experiments so brutally judging myself for not being able to succeed that i began to feel suicidal. im describing this to show the difference between then and now. well the other day, i went to a social meetup at a bar that was meant for ppl new to my area. i was so scared that i walked around the block twice before entering! i tricked myself into entering by telling myself im just going to get a drink, and after that im leaving. upon entering i was immediately welcomed into a group by some random guy who recognized a shirt i was wearing. i nervously joined, but i did alright. it wasnt catastrophically bad. i even made social mistakes, but they didnt result in some giant humiliation, just a brief moment of heightened self consciousness. i went on just fine for an hour with these guys, and then another couple hours with random other people that were all there to meet ppl. it was beautiful! ppl who were all there with the intention of being nice and socializing. lots of ppl i noticed were a little nervous too, which made me realize that its kinda normal to be nervous! its not just me, and im not just broken. the biggest thing ive learned, however, is that my social anxiety is catastrophic and unrealistic. while i still get waves of embarrassment that hit me in conversations, the amount of time i spend fearing humiliation before/after the situation is so much less. it has happened often enough, and under the microscope that cbt has provided me, that i no longer reinforce the irrational idea that my mistakes will result in a giant humiliating event. the emotional side of my brain is really starting to understand that the risk of mistakes are not super high. it allows me to practice consistently, effectively and deliberately. im not ruining my chances quite as much by just telling myself how its gonna go terribly wrong. because this fear has lessened so much, i was able to walk into that bar and say even if the worst case happens, ill be okay. this is not the same as confidence. during conversation, im still a people-pleasing, not-genuine, over-smiling person who rarely lets my actual personality come to the surface. i cant help it yet. but i more often have moments where i allow myself to act natural, and its because im not so incredibly scared of some huge humiliating event. im chipping away at a belief that adds pressure to situations that shouldnt be scary: that every small social mistake can lead to humiliation! basically im getting better! as much as i havent allowed myself to feel small successes (mostly because the idea of a confident me sounds preposterous and unrealistic), i can no longer deny it! the change is so large and obvious that i no longer believe im stuck in this place. i believe there is a path out of this mess, to a more functional life. and im on that path :). its enough to bring me to tears honestly. im 26 and social anxiety disorder has been lifelong, although i have been high functioning for a good portion of my life. but i just wanna say that change is possible. and cbt has really fast tracked that for me. please keep trying, and please get help. you all can do it! i wanna see this world have more people whove recovered from this horrible disorder, and more role models having an online presence. thanks for reading, i hope this does something to encourage you to keep trying. i love you all!",2,1,2,0,0.999752,0.0002480252

48hd6s,"outside , outside , golf","social anxiety with a girl at university. i am a 20 year old male 1st year student at university who is studying accounting. i am really struggling with making friends. in secondary school it is a lot easier to make friends because there are more group activities so is easy to make friends. in university, this is one of the first times i have been put in a situation to make friends from scratch and have bearly met anyone, at most only a few acquaintances. i feel like i don't relate to anyone. the only thing i have relationship wise is with a girl i met in a seminar at the start of the semester. she is attractive girl and was really warm and nice to me so i was instantly in to her. i've never had a girl like that around me before. after that, we always sat next to each other for that one seminar each week and enjoyed each other's company. as the weeks wait by, each lesson she would be really touchy by playfully punching my arm, leaning into me, putting her head on my shoulder and body language signs that she was into me. i was getting to the point where i would of asked her out around xmas time when for the first time we spent time with each other outside class having a coffee by ourselves and by spending that time with her, i was 99% sure she liked me. the opportunity never arose that day as there wasn't a right moment. after the xmas break, in our seminar class where we sit next to eachother, she started to bring her mates into that class where they'd sit together and i would near her but not next to her. it gave us less opportunity to talk and after a few weeks i was not getting the same energy from her. from her being really into me to barely interested at all. i have tried to be around her friends but it's hard for me to approach her with her friends with my sa and being nervous, shaky, racing heart and having a trembling voice in group situations and i don't want to come across bad so i avoid those types of things like going to the cafe with them etc and that's why i only spent time with her in that one seminar. the thought of me losing my chance with her was killing me inside which made my sa worse with me overthinking every little thing she would say to me and she would be the only thing i would think about all day. i know it's over the top to think like that about someone i spend one lesson with per week but i can't help it with this being the first girl i've genuinely like and who also liked me as well, also being a virgin so i don't want to make a mess of it. i came to the conclusion to try and ask her out after the seminar i sit with her. i asked her quietly ""can we talk to you for a minute after class"". she said okay but when the class was fininshed and she was staying behind, her friends asked ""why are you waiting"" to which she replied ""i need to talk to john(me) for a second"". which really baited out what i was going to do because it only means one thing to talk to someone by themselves which threw me asking her out with her friends around the corner 5 yards away. so i ended up asking her in a really uncomfortable way if she wanted to go to the cinema to which she replied ""i need to clean my house this whole week but definitely another time"". i think this is just a nice way of saying no. it's been a week since this has happened and this has really put me down and overall really dislike what i am like around people because i am a decent person to be around once i am comfortable around people. i've struggled sleeping with me not being able to take that moment out of my head and cringing of the thought of that moment by embarrassing myself and messing up the only chance of having a potential girlfriend and some sort of social interaction. i don't have any friends or social life outside university, only play golf but that is a private hobby so this made the situation worse as i don't have anything to fall back on. i have avoided trying to bump into her because of the awkwardness and the fear of the looks i'll get from her friends with them knowing. can anyone give me any advice on what i should do when i next see her next and their opinion on the whole situation with her, if you think there is any chance because i feel confused on how someone could suddenly lose interest. thanks",2,1,2,0,0.9999076,9.239144e-05
501b5k,paddleboarding,"advice for a very lonely guy[25]. i've looked around for a while on google and reddit for helpful advice, but nothing really matches my situation, so i decided to make a profile and see if you people have any advice. i'm not totally sure what my question is, but maybe you can help anyway. i will italicize parts of this post that are optional, but provide some background info for people who want it. i'm on my phone, so i apologize for any spelling/grammar errors. *me: i'm a 25 year old male. i currently live at home with my parents but will be moving out next month into an apartment by myself. i'm a high school teacher with a good education and supportive, loving family. i'm very introverted (intj for those who like that stuff) and have always been slower at making friends. i don't currently have many. i've been in one, 4 month relationship that ended in june 2015, and that was the last time i had sex. i met her because the was the only single, attractive female that i knew through mutual friends. i, myself, am very average in every way.* i have a hard time making a post like this or complaining because there are so many people in the world who have it so much worse than me, but i'm very, very lonely. i usually spend days off and weekends sitting on the computer. i do have hobbies, but they are not ""social"" hobbies (gym, fishing, skiing, more recently stand-up paddleboarding. [these things can be altered to be ""social,"" but i somehow prevent myself from doing that, and generally like to be left alone while i'm doing them]). i live in the midwest, so there's specific windows when i'm able to do each thing. also, i'm not able to do these every day, or sometimes for a few weeks. my current friends have exactly zero interest in these things. *i've recently come to the realization that my friends are actually pretty terrible to me, and really only use me for their own needs. maybe that's the way friendship always is, but i'm not exactly the most social person ever, so i might be difficult to hang out with. i am always the designated driver (started making them pay), and the butt of jokes because i'm not very respected (possibly for my lack of sports knowledge or experience with girls, the two most important things in life). firing back in my own defense (even jokingly) results in ""you're a douchebag"" or ""you don't need to be mean."" in any case, i didn't come here to complain about them, but i'm just describing why i've decided to hang out with them less and less. unfortunately, i don't have anyone to replace them with.* *my co workers are great people, but most are married or in relationships. i dated a teacher from another department a few times this past year before she lost interest for whatever reason and stopped texting me. they always ask when i'm going to find a girlfriend, but i don't have many opportunities to find one.* i try to accept any party or get-together invitations whenever i get them; i don't get them very often. when i do go, i struggle when talking to people or keeping the conversation flowing, especially with girls. i get into the mindset of, ""this person doesn't care what i'm talking about"" or ""i'm just rambling."" i know, it's a bad mindset to have, but i struggle with it nonetheless. the topics usually go to sports or something, but i just don't have anything to offer in that category. i don't watch much tv, and can't keep up with all of the ""stats"" and shit. a lot of advice i've already read is, ""just go find people you have things in common with."" to me, this is a complete mystery. it's almost like saying, ""stop being sick"" to someone who has a cold and expecting it to help. even if i did find people who shared my hobbies, they are often much better at whatever it is, and they see me as some child who wants to follow along. i get the impression that anything i offer is looked over or seen as me being a ""know it all"" because the conversation quickly turns from there and never goes deep. i check my tone and wording, and i can't figure out what i'm doing wrong. *i have a tinder profile but don't get many matches (1-2 per month) i live near a city, so there's never a shortage of girls, but i have high standards, i think. it seems that most girls who fit my standards are not into me. maybe i'm irrational in my standards: petite/slim/athletic (not chubby or ""curvy""), shorter than me (i'm 6'1""), preferably younger than me, and independent. my motto is ""don't hold anyone to standards you can't hold yourself too,"" but maybe i hold myself to standards that most people don't hold themselves to. in any case, matches i do get fizzle out; i'm not very flirty, sexual, or witty.* when social situations do arise, i find it difficult to engage in the conversation or stay focused. in many cases, i just want to go be alone. but i also crave that social contact and desire for acceptance! i feel like when i'm alone i want to be with people, and when i'm with people, i want to be alone. like i said, i'm not totally sure what my question is. maybe it's ""what am i doing wrong"" or maybe it's ""will you help me make friends."" generally, my biggest statement here is ""help."" despite the fact that i was tearing up through this whole post, i'm a grown ass man and i really shouldn't have to ask, but i just need some kind of guidance here. *tldr: i'm a 25 year old male who is very lonely and struggles talking to people or making connections. please help.*",2,1,2,1,1.1373021e-06,0.9999988

qzlpyt, walk,"what does it mean when i'm too shy to ask my coworkers to take me home?. so i have a problem with buses around my workplace, and i was supposed to go home a few times pretty late but it meant i should wait an hour for the bus to arrive. a few of those times i decided i won't wait and walked for 20 minutes on foot in a dangerous path near the road where cars drive literally a few centimeters away from my body to get to another bus station, because i really needed to get home. the thought of asking someone to take me there never occurred to me(even though it's just a 2 minute ride). i honestly just gave excuses to myself as for why i shouldn't ask anyone. because they are busy at work/because there's no one that can take me. i had absolutely no idea i could ask someone to take me there and go back to the workplace, and frankly i didn't even try, i just assumed nobody can. even at times when we have to decide for 1 person to stay, i always feel guilty and selfish when i go home instead of someone else, although i do haves stuff to do at evening. i used to agree to stay but it meant i'd have to do this dangerous 20 minute walk to get to the bus station. i honestly hate that i do this, i make myself so small compared to other people that i'd rather suffer than ask someone to take just 4 minutes of their time to drive me somewhere. i was wondering why i had this fear. maybe i was afraid of bothering them, or of them disliking me because of it, as irrational as i know it is. the fact that i'm a people pleaser really puts me at a tough spot and i hate being like this, i feel so submissive and quiet when i'm really not just because i'm afraid of bothering someone else/angering them/making them dislike me. i can't even confront people face to face, and in the rare occasions i try(usually it's with someone i'm comfortable with), i do it with zero confidence and i prepare to apologize once they react badly. i even have a hard time speaking clearly in front of people i'm uncomfortable around because i don't want to burden them and they end up not hearing me sometimes. i cant pretend it doesn't bother me when someone else is disappointed or disturbed by a decision that i have made, even if i try to take a risk and do it or ask for help. does anyone have tips for how i can overcome people pleasing? how can i overcome being too shy to ask people for help?",2,1,2,1,1.2328343e-06,0.9999988

child i was always considered a shy boy. i didn't speak much when in a group. this made my family and relatives think i was an introvert and didn't have a lot friends (which honestly weirded me out a bit as i was often asked ""you don't have a lot of friends, do you?"" or ""how many friends do you have?""). however, in school, i always felt i was a different person somewhat. i did actually have friends. not as many as someone not anxious or not shy, but i always put myself around my friends when in school. so anyway, fast forward a few years to the last year in my school, i finally started talking with girls of my class. so by now you may have figured i was less shy than before. but still a lot shy. around this time you would expect a guy to hang out with his friends all the time. *i believe i low key always wanted that.* however, i lived some 6 miles from my school and i had no bicycle or motor vehicle to travel that far every day (as most of my school friends lived near the school). so i ended up staying at home all day and playing video games. with girls (and now women), i had it worse. till about my 11th grade, i didnt speak to a lot of girls. barely if any. in my 11th grade, i started making a few girl friends but i never talked to them as much as my guy friends. we hung out like once or twice but once school was over i couldnt meet them as often and didn't text them a lot either. moving on to relationships, the first true crush i had was in 7th grade i believe. she lived close to me and went to school in the same bus. i first texted her on social media and we got to talking. i believe we became ""social media"" friends but i never really talked to her in person because i was afraid of i dont know what. she eventually left my school and i never really got to talk to her again. the second crush i had was the time i started approaching girls. i still didnt talk as much as a normal guy would but i met this girl in my class. we sat next to each other waiting for our class to begin. 15 minutes of silence later i asked for the time or something. we started talking and moved on to texting. this time i spoke in person more than last time (but again, not as much as a normal person would). we became really good friends. she suddenly disappeared so that was over. **this was my school life** now comes my recent university life. i was more outgoing now that i had to stay in my university for atleast 8 hours a day. my life was definitely happier (since surprise, i am actually an extrovert). i was still a bit shy but i no longer was scared of casual group gatherings. in fact, i enjoyed those. life still sucked past 5 pm because i still did not have a mode of transport to travel 8 miles everyday. but it was better than before. here i met my third crush. she is an introvert and had an attitude. i could now talk to women better (again, not as good as a normal guy) but something about her made me very nervous. i tried talking to her for 2 years, couldn't. in my 3rd year was when i started talking to her properly. but she never showed interest in knowing me so i eventually lost interest in her and generally avoid her. and this was my history of my anxiety. i finished my 4 years in the university yesterday. about six months ago i was at my absolute worst. i still couldnt hang out with my friends after 5 pm. i had to stay home after that and i started getting depressed and had negative thoughts. anxiety peaked. thats when my father said something to my younger sister, you and your mother are the only extroverts in our house. something did not feel right. i knew the actual meaning of both the terms, and i didnt feel like an introvert that my father labelled me. i soon learned that i am actually an extrovert, but i had social anxiety. thats when i first came across the term. realising that i had social anxiety helped me a lot to fight it. i suddenly had my anxiety decreased a lot. i now make friends very easily. i have made more friends in the past 6 months than i had made in the past 4 years. obviously, in situations i realised that my fears were irrational. however, i haven't been completely been able to overcome it. i will give some instances. &gt;**1** i am still not great at talking with women. i have always felt that i am a sub-human. i think that i am not good looking (even though i have been told otherwise), i will bore them if i talk to them which means i can't make the first move ever, or that something about me will repel any potential dates i could have. &gt;**2** my family has been broke for the past 4 years. my (fairly) large friend circle asks me to hang out. one friend circle spends a lot of money so i haven't hanged out with them in about 2-3 years. i feel bad about it but for some reason i can't tell them that i am broke as fuck. i can't afford to go to a restaurant or coffee place every other day and have some a grade shit. they feel that i don't think them as friends anymore. and my anxiety makes me feel really bad about it. &gt;**3** sometimes i feel truly confident. very confident in fact. in that state sometimes i get the job done whatever it may be, but sometimes when the work actually comes, i panic and stop myself from doing the work or avoid the public gathering. i realise that my fear is irrational but it just consumes me. &gt;**4** sports. as i said, anxiety and shyness are truly fucking terrible. i never was able to play sports for long because i felt i sucked and everyone hated me for that. today as i am less anxious and more interested in sports, i feel like playing a soccer, but most of my friends have been playing (with people) for several years and they are atleast good at it. i know i can't keep up with them and honestly it doesnt matter because at this age, they aren't going to make it to the international leagues either. but for some reason, i fear being judged still. &gt;**5** i made a few girl friends over the years now but i still can't talk to them as much because i feel i will be boring to them. my anxiety ruins my friendships with them. one of the main reason why i truly want to get over my anxiety. when i talk to them i realise that these girls consider me a friend, but i can't just speak with them properly and maintain that friendship. in january, i plan on started mma classes since i learned that physical fitness and exercise helps in you confidence, a lot. but i want some other advises that can make me get over my anxiety completely. my life would be so much better if i do, so please help. thank you",2,1,2,1,6.2714366e-06,0.9999937

b1wlb8,"Outside , outside , bicycle","i don't know how to approach this... so, this is a bit complicated.i'm a 19 y/o guy studying at university at the moment. this is my third year in uni, 2nd in my current study programme (i quit my first study on a different uni). i haven't really made any real friendships/connections from uni, although i often work with one person i can get along with very well. outside of studying we don't really do anything outside of uni.in the first year at the other uni, i didn't have any friends except my cousin with whom i often play games via discord and formerly teamspeak. when i was in high school, i didn't have any friends. i tried to connect with other people, but i was too anxious. the 6 years i was in high school was definitely the worst time of my life. especially in the lunch breaks i felt horrible, i often went home on my bicycle, even though it took up a large part of the break time. i did this because i did't know where to sit (our school was horribly crowded in the breaks, there weren't even enough tables). i also feared sitting with my classmates, this fear grew stronger in the later years. back to my cousin, he plays an important role in my current social life. he was in a different high school, and i was 2 years ahead of him. around 2014-15 we started gaming via teamspeak, which was a big relief for me, as i didn't have any other way to socialize with people. after a while, a few classmates of his also joined, and ever since we still talk via discord all the time. currently it's my cousin, my brother (he was 2 grades lower at my high school, i will explain his role in the story below) and two friends of my cousin (classmates) which are in discord all the time, and we are basically friends. when i quit my first year on uni halfway through, i started working at a supermarket for a while before starting my next study. while working there, i saw my cousin's classmates for the first time, which was a bit awkward, but nothing too bad. it was nice seeing them irl for the first time. now my brother. he is 1 year younger than me, and was 2 grades below me. he did have some friends, but one best friend which he still is. since around 2016, when i was in my last year, he went to the disco/club (not sure what to call it, it's basically an empty hall packed with people where dance/big room house is played by a dj) with my cousin and some other friends, and he quickly made friends with those people (including the teamspeak/discord group). i forgot the order in which the connections grew, but it's not that important. back to today, what it comes down to is that my brother, his friend, and the friend group of my cousin (and kinda me, limited to discord) became one big friend group. for like 2 years now, they go the the club almost every saturday or friday night. and i? i never went to a club even once. i'm too socially anxious. in the beginning i was not interested in night-life, however, after a while i regret never going. it would have been a great way to get to know the friend group better.i feel like i'm too late at this point in time. every time they go out, they send video's and pictures on our snapchat group chat, and it makes me feel sick in the stomach to see them having fun, while i'm at home doing nothing. aside from going to the club, they do a lot more fun things together like going on a vacation to spain, and this year to albufeira, or going to birthday parties or other random parties from people i don't even know. i feel horrible to be disconnected from those events, and the fact that they have many more friends than me. the problem i have is that i don't how to get involved in those social activities. i'm extremely anxious to go to the club with them, especially because they have done it a myriad of times, while i have never been to the club. a few times my cousin has asked me to join, but i said no because i was too anxious. i instantly regret it, but didn't do anything about it. after all this time i fear to go with them, i don't how to behave at the club, and them having all this 'experience' makes it even worse.the fact that my brother is involved in all these social events makes it extra hard for me, it makes me feel like an outcast. i've always portrayed myself to my brother as someone who doesn't like parties and that kind of stuff. i feel like i need to break this image of myself from my brother and my cousin. i feel like it would've been a lot easier if my brother wasn't involved in this group of friends. i would greatly appreciate if someone can help me break the status quo and get more connected with my friends. the greatest fear that i need to break is going to the club with them, which feels like a massive threshold.maybe someone has been through something similar, and can share his or her experience.",2,1,2,1,1.1256731e-06,0.9999989
57jul7,"benches, outside ","i just got back from my first date ever.. i am 20 years old and male. like many of you my social anxiety has made me shy away from women and dating. a couple months ago i met a girl a couple years older than me that works at my mom's workplace. for a long time i didn't reach out to her out of fear of the outcome, as well as self destructive thoughts: ""she's too good for me"" ""it's been too long. it would be wierd now"". i got myself into a better place mentally and finally realized i have nothing to lose by trying. i texted her saying i would like to get to know her better and i asked if she wanted to get coffee with me. she agreed and we planned a time. getting that message saying she did want to go out with me made me the happiest i have felt in awhile. it was almost like a drug. i read the message and a wave of happiness washed over me and suddenly i got the motivation to just do something. so i did some exercising which i have a lot of trouble making myself do. a few days later she told me she was going to meet a (female) friend afterward to eat and asked if i wanted to join them after the two of us got coffee. i agreed. initally i was really excited, but as the day approached that excitement was replaced with anxiety. about 30 minutes before my stomach was in knots. on the drive there i was doing deep breathing exercises to keep myself from freaking out. i was early so i was in my car repeating to myself: ""you can do this"" ""she is just a regular person"" ""she is going to be nervous too"" then i saw her walk into the coffee shop. ""this is it"" i told myself. i got out and walked in. i saw her and we said hello and exchanged pleasantries. we ordered and she said she would pay for herself. i said i was happy to get it for her, but i did not insist and i let her pay for herself. we walked out to the benches outside and talked for awhile. i had done lots of research on first date conversation to prepare myself. we talked about her job, our pets and my job. we both went to the same university, but at different times. we both dropped out. that created quite a bit of conversation topics. we even got off on a political discussion somehow. this actually worked out well since we have similar views on the subject. afterward we walked to the restaurant which was just down the road and met her friend. it was actually really nice having her friend there. it took some of the pressure off me to keep conversation going. again we all paid for our own food, but i did offer to take care of the appetizer we all shared and i did. once the night was over her friend left and just me and her walked together until we got to my car. we said goodnight and she said she would like to see more of me. i said i wanted to see her again as well and we went our separate ways. i feel so accomplished. i kicked my anxiety in the nads and did something that makes even a normal person nervous. sure i was a little quiet and i didn't say a whole whole lot about myself. still i'm glad i got the chance to get to know her and to my suprise i actually had quite a bit of fun.",2,1,2,1,1.3689075e-06,0.9999987

5pg185,"run , basketball","it's my birthday today and i hate the trajectory my life is taking.. i just turned twenty 3 hours ago and am no longer a teenager. i have noticed that my life trajectory is heavily sloping downwards. i consider myself to have two real friends, both who are on the other side of the us going to a different university so i will be spending it alone with my parents (i have never had a conversation with them longer than 5 minutes because of a serious language barrier). also my sister and i do not get along at all, so i have no strong familial connections. i withdrew from church when i was 16 because i lost my faith, and only now realize that i lost so many genuine friends along with it. i go to my state university, so i see them around but i actively avoid them due to my sa. they invite me on facebook to church events but i always decline. and i always worry about how many people will post hbd to my facebook wall. i probably average 8-12 a year, and it always makes me sad when i see some getting 60+. i've never had a girlfriend or even a female friend i would consider close. i don't consider myself to be attractive, but i definitely don't think i'm unattractive. i am more on the lean side because i run and play basketball. in eigth grade (before puberty really hit me and developed my sa), i remember heavily flirting with this cute girl in 7th grade and developed a strong bond. then i didn't see her for a year cause i went to high school (9th grade) and she was in 8th grade. i'll never forget the moment the year after when she came up to me (when i was 10th grade and she was 9th grade) and said hi all excitedly, and i pretended that i barely knew her because i didn't know how to handle the situation and gave her a very uninterested response even though i still liked her. then when i was in senior year of high school, she became my physics ap partner by some random luck and i felt so awkward every single day. she eventually ended up dating one of my ""friends"" which killed me inside. this may sound pathetic but i still like her a lot and sometimes fantasize about her in my dreams (like what it would be like to spend a day with her at the county fair). i realize this is unhealthy but i can't help it all the current friends i have are stoners and druggies. i experimented heavily with weed in senior year, and eventually everyone in my social group in high school smoked weed constantly including me. i believe there's nothing wrong with weed, but i sort of had a revelation in sophomore year of college that i didn't want to be a druggie (they started doing shit like xanax, molly, oxy, lsd, whippets, and i just didn't want to associate with them), so i stopped hanging out with them. and college. oh boy. i thought this would be where my life would change for the better. nope, i'm still a shitty human being with zero social skills and it's tough making friends as a shitty human being with zero social skills. i went to one party and ended up puking everywhere and i try to repress that memory. i also have zero hobbies besides video games. i always thought at least i was smart, but college sure proved me wrong (i always score average on exams now). i'm struggling to maintain my scholarship (i need a cumulative 3.2 and i have a 3.25 right now) so here i am. a little drunk in my bed on my phone, nowhere near close to feeling sleepy. i really just wanted to rant. my social anxiety for sure caused my depression since 12th grade, and freshmen year of college i went through some heavy suicidal thoughts. at least now they aren't as frequent and don't hit as hard sophomore year. basically, i fail at living life. i wish you all eventually find happiness if you're struggling with it, and i hope we are all able to overcome our social anxiety/depression one day. edit: holy shit i did not realize i wrote this much. i'll probably end up deleting this when i wake up tomorrow morning anyways",2,1,2,1,2.2560905e-06,0.99999774

eacyld8,outside,"i feel you, it could've been me writing this story. they say that our anxiety causes up to make stupid decisions but i had a similar situation to yours and took the alternate route. i was around 14 at the time. my mum dropped me off at the bank to do a transaction that takes about half an hour to process while she went to the supermarket next door to shop. it took about an hour to get to a teller and finish the transaction then i called my mum to let her know i was finished. she wouldn't answer. it was raining outside so i just decided to sit back down in the waiting area figuring she would call me when she's ready. over the next hour, the waiting area clears and the tellers keep glancing at me probably wondering why i was loitering. i lean back and doze off. i feel a tap on my leg and open my eyes to see a manager and security guard in front of me. the manager asks if i need help with something and i say no that i'm just waiting on my mum to pick me up. she gives me an odd look and says okay and nods to the security guard. i check my phone and realise i've been sleeping for 30 minutes. before i can decide what i'm going to do i get a call. it's my dad. he sounds angry and asks where i am. i tell him i'm in the bank waiting for mum to come back for me. he then tells me that someone in the bank called and told him that i was there sleeping in the waiting area well after i had finished my business with the bank. he said i looked like an idiot just sitting there. after he hangs up, i look around and see the tellers and security guards staring at me again; they probably heard my conversation. i pack up and go outside and stand behind a column so no one in the bank could see me waiting. about 20 minutes later my mum pulls up and i get in the car. she asks how long i've been waiting and then why i hadn't just gone to the supermarket when i finished. i don't know. i was so embarrassed by the whole situation. i never went back to that branch but after it closed, some of the staff were moved to the other branch i used in order to avoid ever seeing those people again. it'd be another hour to find the next closest branch so i've been stuck seeing these people since.",2,1,2,1,3.04408e-05,0.9999696

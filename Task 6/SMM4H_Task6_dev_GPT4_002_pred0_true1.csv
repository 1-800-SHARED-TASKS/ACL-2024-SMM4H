8866,i was 25 when i had the surgery done in my right eye. was starting to get around 20/100 in my eye. had the prk/crosslinking with riboflavin done and my vision improved immensely as a result. 9 years later and it has slipped a bit but i can still see 20/20 in this eye with reading glasses.,reddit,1,0
8918,"first, other than glasses, my vision is fine. no apparent problems. 40m, 175lbs. however, i've noticed something strange. i can close only my left eye easily and look around with my right eye without effort. it take more muscle to only close my right eye. like i am squinting hard or something. also, while closed, my open left eye has a much more narrow range of movement without causing my right eye to open. no pain, no pressure, just something that's bugging me for decades.",reddit,1,0

12161,"i don't belong anywhere and i want to cry - tw: suic*de i'm writing this from my other account as i want to retain my anonymity. i just moved in with my partner and his parents - we lived with my parents in my home country for a few years but things didn't work out for us over there, so we decided to move to my partner's home country instead. i have severe social anxiety and depression. i take antidepressants, and for the most part they have worked amazingly, my anxiety is definitely less. i just feel so stressed out because we have been socialising all day, and the bedroom door leads to the living room with the sofas literally right outside the door. this means if i want to have some 'down time', i can't because i'm on full display, and if i shut the door then i feel incredibly rude. either way, it makes me even more anxious as i feel like i need somewhere i can unwind when things get too much. the thing is, i've spend 23 years living with my narcissistic mother and a brother with severe mental illness who both made my life a living hell. once they decided i was no longer a fun target, they took to completely ignoring my existence instead. the past couple of years have been incredibly lonely, and in that time the ideas i have that no one likes me or wants to be around me have only been reinforced. now that i'm here, i spend most of my time sitting there feeling like part of the furniture, as i'm so anxious and i don't know what to do or say, that i just tend to fade into the background. i go to bed feeling on the verge of collapsing - i don't even have the energy to do anything i want to do because i feel completely exhausted. i don't know why socialising makes me so fatigued, but it's horrible. for the record, i am incredibly grateful to be here, i adore everyone and they have been so kind to me. but i just feel like i don't belong. not here, not anywhere. by the end of the day, i've spent all of it attentively listening to everyone and trying my best to engage even though i struggle to talk. i just feel so useless. sometimes i feel like it would have been better for me to stay at home with my fucked up family, because i just feel like a burden here, and an even bigger burden to my boyfriend. i don't want to be alive anymore, but i'm not suicidal, i've felt this way for a while. i just feel like i've been struggling for so many years, and even living in a beautiful country far away from my family, i still feel hollow and empty. i can't outrun my mind. i feel **incompatible** with life, and that's a word that has followed me since i was a young teen. i'm tired, and i simply don't fit in anywhere, with anyone. i know the problem is 100% me, but it just doesn't get any better. i've become estranged from my family, i have no friends, and i can't keep unloading all my shit on my poor bf. i know there's no easy answer to this, but at least venting is supposed to be therapeutic.",reddit,1,0
12187,"im almost 20 and scared of teenagers and young people in general. - i'm basically scared of people who are young. i think it all started when i was in 7th grade. in 7th i was bullied badly by a group of girls and it soon spread to the entire school spreading rumors about me and backstabbing me. i was pretty much convinced everyone hated me. well now i'm almost 20 and as my mom says ""a woman"". she says that i'm stuck in a ""teenager mode"" and need to stop caring what other people think. the problem is, i have a larger nose that i get made fun of for. it's mostly by girls who are younger than i am. i want to go to the mall to shop, but every time i'm always being laughed at. my mom is right about not caring what other people think. though i have so much insecurity, i'm like a teenager. it's like i'm stuck in that mode where i think i'm in high school and i'm putting myself in that victim mentality by saying i'm being bullied and i hate it! most of the time, when i run into a group of young teenagers i get intimidated and try to avoid them at all costs.

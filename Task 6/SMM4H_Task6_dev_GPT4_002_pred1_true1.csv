8804,"dear doctor of optometrists of the internet i am asking advice based on multiple different opinions. firstly i have two optometrists due to one having all my history and one recently that performs a more comprehensive exam. the one with my history told me i'd be more eligible and satisfied with icl, whereas my new optometrist said lasik. me being a worrier and avid researcher when making decisions went in for multiple consults. i had 3 lasik places that gave me the label of b- on candidacy and 1 that told me i was too borderline for it. they told me it was one and done procedure due to my high myopia. i'm 28 going on 29 male my script is l -8.75 sph -1.25 cyl axis 180 r -7.25 sph -2.00 cyl axis 180. my k value was 46 for both eyes where they said i'd be 38 post op. corneal thickness was 556 preop with 320 on my left and high 330s for my right. they set a treatment optic zone of 6.0. with lasik my concerns would be dry eye, ectasia, and night glare that may not be treatable and also outcomes you guys have seen with patients with high myopia treated with lasik because i'm hoping you guys have insight. icl was recommended due to its reversibility and less complications of dry eye and night vision problems also possibility of enhancement. my concern with icl is glaucoma. my great grandmother on of my dads mom and my moms dad had it. my eye pressure is around 19-20 mmhg. i have been told by all refractive surgery centers i'm in a unique position as i am a decent candidate for all. but lasik or prk would be a one time treatment. and i've been told to not due prk due to haze. in terms of stabilization i was a -7.5 l and -6.5 right at 18. with same astigmatism. at 27 i got -8.0 l and - 7.0 r. after not wearing contacts for examination i got the new script which was apparently due to my cornea going back to normal shape. i use to wear toric soft lenses. also i had lattice degeneration that was treated with laser by my retina specialist he said no other complications exist in terms of macula or optic nerve. i guess i'm kind of lost on the decision to make and wondering what professionals have seen with high myopic patients in terms of refractive surgery.",reddit,1,1
8807,"hello, i've been briefly scanning this thread and i was hoping to have some answers from those directly affected by sjogrens syndrome... this will be sort of long in explanation but i'm generally discomforted and concerned. to begin, i'm 18/f. auto immune disorders like lupus and ra have been running in my family for some time and i've been experiencing symptoms that a doctor had suggested could be caused by sjogrens. this is a severe diagnosis and my family members with lupus explained it's taken them years to be officially diagnosed and that i should be concerned and get into contact with a rheumatologist. i wondered if it was worth it for my symptoms and if diagnosis was equally hard with sjogrens like lupus or if it's a true negative no matter what ? what finally lead to an official diagnosis for you all and what qualifies as enough in your opinion to seek a specialist? i experience the sensation of dry nose, throat mouth and eyes (occasionally itchiness of my eyes) causing my head to hurt, i'll randomly become dizzy and pressure will accumulate around my face. it's at its worst when i wake up and when im trying to sleep, however still very prominent throughout my day and noticeable. the best way i could describe it, is that it burns to breathe through my nose like things are too cold or not wet enough and it makes a dry, painful sensation in my throat despite posnasal drip. it irritates my mouth and eyes, feeling like i woke up with cotton mouth or i'm hung over. i struggle swallowing, making it hard to sleep as i constantly feel like there's a lump in my throat, i feel like i'm choking when my nose suddenly is dry and no longer ""clear""<u+009d>. it'll occasionally hurt to talk too long and i constantly have a dry cough because i'm always trying to subconsciously fix it. it's like feeling winded and having a dry spot in your throat from not swallowing enough so you constantly do it to fix it. it also makes me feel as though i swallow food down the wrong tube. i was only prompted with this diagnosis after being irritated enough to think i had strep throat and further explaining my symptoms. the test came back negative. on and off for the last year or two, i've exhibited these symptoms accompanied by weird facial burning like a sunburn sensation, excessive heartburn, occasional dizziness and aching of places where i've had broken bones prior or my joints, most generally being in my arms and legs. it has brief periods where it's barely noticeable and it's not a raging irritation. it's not that it hurts painfully bad usually, but rather its very mild and seems never ending enough for me to despise it and not ignore it. i was tested for lupus, sjogrens and ra all of which came back negative so my doctors are trying to move on (which is great if there's an actual solution) but i know how long it took my relatives to officially be diagnosed or finally dismissed. however, i'm still so uncomfortable and now my doctors seem to be testing me for things that don't exactly make sense as a whole like influenza or lyme. they've also attributed my symptoms to be caused by anxiety and stress as i have a lot going on however, if anyone in this thread knows what anxiety dryness, numbness/weakness or throat irritation is like, you'll too, know that it's not the same as what i'm describing- it being that it's not a response to adrenaline or worrying. what i experience is rather constant. (as for the lab tests, i'll have the results monday the 13th) my symptoms fluctuate in intensity and lately my body is becoming less dry as i think it's overcoming the intensity from this ""flare""<u+009d> as my aunt with lupus suggests. i still have the sensation of dryness 2/3 times but there's clearly moisture in at least my mouth right now. like my mouth for example, it's usually extremely dry due to my nose being dry and it leads to dry eye and pain in my face. now it seems to be less intense. (i don't know if that's from the help of biotene or eye drops however). it was a strong few months of it climaxing to its worst and my symptoms by no means have completely subsided. i recognize what i'm feeling from this time last year and from when i suspect that it's began as a whole, the end of summer both years in a row, now. i do have seasonal allergies but they present with congestion, pressure in different places... so i've ruled that out. also is it normal to have dry crusty sensation in the nose and eyes even with some moisture being present? sounds silly, i know... and does anyone find that the more water they drink the headache increases or that spit becomes more thick and harder to swallow?.. ive tried sinus meds, eye drops that sometimes burn but usually feel so relieving ( meant for moisture) saline spray which dries me out and burns- i now use something specifically for moisture but i feel like it just drops to my throat and irritates, i've tried cold and flu meds... i constantly moisturize as i've struggled with dry skin since i was a little girl and still my skin gets patchy or my lips will peel and crack ( i use chapsticks and scrubs like it's my job! it makes no sense)... i drink upwards of two gallons of water trying to remain comfortable, using biotene sprays and eye drops and coconut oil for moisture. i take ibuprofen for pain and use heating pads for pain as well. a humidifier is present and i try to keep room on the colder side. i have central air heating. hydration is very important to me as it's been an irritant in my life for a long time, suddenly it doesn't seem as effective as normal. i do not drink coffee and i've cut out smoking or vaping for 4-5 months now. i was hoping to see if my symptoms are still valid of sjogrens or if maybe there's hope for something else less serious that i could bring up in an appointment for those of you who had their sjogrens misdiagnosed originally? maybe i'm experiencing symptoms of something else. more blatantly said, i'm not looking for a diagnosis but, rather, i'm trying to become more educated on the topic as i'm losing sleep from the irritation, constant urination and am generally very discomforted all day. online research is hard and cryptic in my opinion, as well as not always accurate. i figured asking real people would be more beneficial. i'm open to any and all suggestions if you've read this far. the best to you all who struggle with an auto immune issue especially sjogrens. thanks again!! please ask any questions you may need for a better understanding, i'm very desperate as health issues spark my anxiousness and work me up lol i'm sorry if i sound dumb or should be asking in a different subreddit.",reddit,1,1
8810,ok so i came back from the retina specialist today. he diagnosed me with a mild hyphema and i am treating it as we speak. i'm not nervous about the hyphema but about the possibility of getting glaucoma. i am only 15 and i never had any eye problems. i was hit with a ball. i heard if pressure is built up for a while it can cause glaucoma. my vision actually came back a few hours after trauma but when i was trying to go to bed i think the hyphema bled again. my vision was blurry again. it was already midnight so i just slept on it. when i woke up it was still blurry so i immediately went to the eye doc in the morning. he said my eye pressure was super high and gave me eye drops to bring it down. today i went to the retina specialist and he said i had no viewable retina damage. (took an ultrasound) and also didn't think there was any optic nerve damage. my peripheral vision is not black or cut off i still have my full field of vision but everything is blurry. the blurriness has gotten a little better. which the doc said is the blood from hyphema but i just wanna ask you guys if it could possibly be glaucoma and if i should ask.,reddit,1,1

8830,"48 m here. did they do an ana test? typically a rheumatologist will check for a high number on an ana test to determine if you have some sort of autoimmune issue. it won't tell you which one, but it's the best indicator that your body is attacking itself. if you do end up with ss, look into low dose naltrexone. it's helped me tremendously but mainly in regard to fatigue and brain fog which you thankfully don't appear to have yet.",reddit,1,1

8833,"hey all new here. so i was dxed with kc in both eyes, right slightly worse then left,10 years ago when i went for a lasik consult, like many of you i assume. i have had glasses since i was 10, 36 now. after my dx i started seeing a cornea doc. every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly for the next 6 years, now i go every 2 years. since my dx my vision has not changed, i wear acuvue oasis soft contacts (-2.75 each eye), and get close to 20/20, i also have fine correction with my glasses. my kc topography has been the same since my first scan. so it's very mild and naturally stable. likely from eye rubbing as a kid from my bad allergies. recently i have been reading some peer reviewed articles about kc and icl. the results seem very promising for a case such as mine. i compared my topography numbers with the subjects and i am well within the parameters they published in all the articles. so anyway i found a cornea specialist who does all the various corrective procedures including icl. i just stopped wearing my contacts and see him for a consultation in 2 weeks. i am not getting all hopeful, just curious about how 10 years has advanced this stuff. should he think the icls are a good option for my particular case i'd be hard pressed not to really consider it just sharing my story and seeing if anyone has thoughts or personal experience with icls and kc be well.",reddit,1,1

8840,hi. i developed a 1mm peripheral corneal ulcer on friday morning from accidentally sleeping in my contacts one night. i have now been on two forms of antibiotics since then and today the doctor told me to start steroid drops to reduce the scar and mild corneal inflammation. i'm a little afraid to start the drops (prednilosone 1%) because i've recorded high iop a few times and i'm terrified of getting glaucoma. my iop ranges from 18-22 but i have thick corneas and normal visual fields. i'm healthy 22 white female with no family history of glaucoma but i do have moderate myopia. i'm going to get checked again on wednesday and my doc said they would monitor it. i know i should just trust them but i struggle a bit with ocd and glaucoma really scares me. i'm also curious how likely it is for that little white ulcer dot to stay forever? thank you so much for your time and help. i really appreciate it.,reddit,1,1
8841,"that last sentence sounds like the optometrist thinks you were 'overminused' in your original rx. from the optometrists i work with, it's quite easy to overminus myopes because sometimes as patients, we report that a power that is too strong is the best one when an optometrist is refracting us on the phoropter. i myself was overminused once, so that's why i think you've gone 'down' a half dioptre in the sphere. of course it's something to avoid because it can give you headaches and feeling like you're straining but it does happen your astigmatism correction hasn't increased a wide amount at all, it seems quite regular to me. most people's prescriptions stabilise around late teens to mid 20s. mine has only just started stabilising (turning 21). i've dispensed glasses for patients whose prescriptions are still changing in their early 30s and aren't presbyopic or having any pathology. so it is variable so referencing your title - nope your rx change isn't too big for your age. good luck with dental school and look into contacts if you haven't already, your specs must be quite thick at the edges. although when you write about the original values having a bc of 4, bc means base curve to me which is a value i associate with contacts? but i'm australian and our base curves are like 8.4 and 8.6 which is lots larger than 4 lol. maybe different unit of measurement.",reddit,1,1
8843,"hi there :) i'm really sorry you are going through this, but you are going in the right direction. to realise that something is wrong is the most important part of the journey. now you just need to find the right rheumatologist. i'm saying ""right"" because not every doctor will be convinced that you need help, especially if your tests are negative i was diagnosed about a year ago. i'm 33 now. before that it was a never ending battle between me and the doctors. all my tests were negative so i was ""totally fine"". the only thing that convinced my rheumatologist that i do have sjogren's was my lip biopsy. it proved it. so i think you should start with that. lip biopsy can't be wrong. if you have sjogren's even in it's beginning stage, it will show it. i was just like you once. living with all my issues thinking that it's ""normal "". it's not normal. life is so much better when you know how to manage your illness. now i fight fiercely for my health and no doctor can tell me that i'm imagining things. as for plaquenil, i started taking it as soon as i got diagnosed. i'm also taking prednisolone and naproxen for pain management. i don't know what other symptoms you have so you decide if you need medications or not. i have severe joint pain and fatigue, so these medications really help. also these medications stop the progression of the disease. if the disease doesn't progress you don't develop lymphoma. or at least that's what i was told. honestly, i don't see any harm in taking plaquenil, but prednisolone is pure evel. horrible side effects. doesn't worth it. vitamins, omega 3, good diet and exercise are the best way to start. if you don't have worse symptoms than your dryness then maybe you don't need to start plaquenil right away. first you have to find a good rheumatologist and do that lip biopsy. if you have any questions feel free to ask. best of luck to you and stay healthy.",reddit,1,1

8888,your kmax is low just get the cxl only and follow your doctor advice. your in similar position to me but mine is a lot worse. since prk needs around 50 microns it's best to do it above 500 since your below that's why advised cxl only. after cxl my kmax went down by 2d so expect a reduction of 1-2d from 50 and 55. your situation is good. you can get improvements it's good your acting early on the cxl. are you doing both eyes or the bad eye? i haven't had my good eye done am 25 and monitoring for progression. also there are many procedures on the horizon such as ctak (which adds cornea thickness) ivmed drops which will aim to flatten cornea and other laser advancements. in our lifetime it's likely they will fix this by stem cell research so support that as much as you can lol.,reddit,1,1
8890,"so here's the basic story: i'm 31m, have kc. have been feeling very anxious lately about losing my sight, tbh. my left eye has kc but with glasses it is fine. i get close enough to 20/20, and i only notice minor weird things like higher-order aberrations in my left eye. my right eye is totally useless. i've tried every kind of lens, including rgps and sclerals. i have one main question: now that i pretty much depend on my left eye to do my job, and since i haven't seen any progression in it, is it advisable to get cxl? my doctor said that it was my choice, that it could progress rapidly, or it could just stay like this forever, but that it was hard to say. my big worry is that my right eye is not corrected well. i've tried a lot of combinations of lenses in that eye, but no matter what, the astigmatism is just too intense to really use it. i've tried synergeyes, soft lenses, rgps, and one kind of advanced lens design. i feel bad, because a lot of quite-good lens fitters have fitted the eye and the best i can get is ""good enough"" vision in full light (still lots of hoas). one of my fitters said there might be an underlying lens problem in my right eye and that i may never be able to expect truly ""good"" vision from the eye. so in light of this, i have a few questions: * my left eye isn't noticably progressing. the amount of ho loss in that eye is fairly minimal, and regular astigmatism is correctable with just glasses. is it possible that cxl will induce astigmatism that can't be corrected with glasses? what are the rough chances that that will end up happening? * glasses leave right eye uncorrected, but it can't really be truly corrected with sclerals/gps either. as in, i can't use a computer monitor with my right eye even with a variety of lenses. * is it worth considering intacs in the right eye? prk? the is basically useless at this point.. i realize you all likely can't give a solid answer, but would be happy for any insight i can get.",reddit,1,1

8911,"this is going to be a long history but i'd love to hear insight if anyone has ever experienced anything similar. i've got a ton of doctors involved but would love to give this a shot. i am 31 years old and i have always been healthy. within the last few months i've noticed that i started having a tremor in my right hand, a lot of weakness in my hand and a lot of pain in my feet. i have a hard time walking when i wake up in the morning or when i've been sitting for awhile. the best way i can describe it is that the bones ache. i have been clumsy and dropping things a lot. i've also been having issues with my vision - but really couldn't pinpoint what the issue was. sometimes i feel like i'm looking through water and my depth perception is off. i do have 3 kids under the age of 5 but i am beyond exhausted. i sleep great at night but i just wake up so so tired. i got my family doctor involved about 6 weeks ago. she did an examination and ran a huge panel of blood work. she also referred me to a neurologist. all of my blood work has come back normal. i went to the eye dr as well and explained what was going on and she didn't see anything concerning but didn't like my symptoms. she agreed with the neurologist referral. i saw the neurologist about a month ago. it was a very long appointment with a physical exam and history. he ended the appointment explaining that he thinks i have an issue with my peripheral nervous system. the initial concern with my eye dr and family dr was possibly ms. the neurologist said he didn't think so. he ordered an emg (still waiting) and an mri (scheduled for oct 2). the neurologist believed my optic nerve looked okay and didn't think there was any optic neuritis. ffwd to last week. my husband and i were watching a hockey game and i took my glasses off to look at my phone. i looked up and realized that i could actually read the score. my vision is -3.50 in both eyes and i can basically just see blurred color without my glasses on. i then realized that only my right eye could see well. my left was still the same. i booked in to see my eye dr again the next day. she was immediately concerned. she did a pressure test and read that my right eye was now a 0.0. it had fully improved to 20/20 vision. she did some scans and showed me that my macula looked very strange and that it appeared to be wrinkled. she said i needed to be seen by an ophthalmologist. she told me that typically what causes the macula to wrinkle is from pressure behind the eye. this is also what causes the improved vision as it shortens the lens of the eye. she told me her concern was that there may be a tumor behind my eye. cue freaking out. the next day i was seen by an ophthalmologist at the hospital. he did a ton of tests and scans and agreed with my optometrists concerns. he saw the wrinkling on my macula and sent me straight for a ct. he told me his concern was also a tumor. 2 hours later i was back in his office and he gave me the news that the ct was clear. no tumor. he said he was extremely surprised as he was quite convinced it was a tumor. he then told me i needed to be seen by a retina specialist as he believed the blood vessels behind my eye were swollen and had no idea on the reason. again, the next day, i saw the retina specialist. he must have spent 30 minutes looking at my eye at a ton of different angles. he said ""wow this is an interesting one for a saturday morning!""<u+009d> he thought maybe my optic nerve was a bit swollen but not very much. he also agreed that i had coroidal folds on my macula and had absolutely no idea why. he is a renowned doctor and said he's very stumped by my case and said he will dig deep to find answers. he said he believes there is sort of rate condition or disease causing this. he said the vision shift from a -3.50 to a 0 is extremely concerning and that we absolutely need to find the cause. on monday i have a ton more scans at his office, an ultrasound and a fluorescein angiography. he's going to be working with my neurologist to see if they can figure out what's going on. i feel scared and also just really tired. i want to know what's going on and no one seems to have a clue. if you made it this far - i appreciate your thoughts and time! here's to a diagnosis sometime soonish!",reddit,1,1

8947,"i've noticed an uptick in new users that have been diagnosed and thought i'd share a bit of my story and an update. to start i was diagnosed last year at the age of 24. it started around the time i had a sinus infection and my eyes get really irritated and watery so i was rubbing them all week. i was driving home one night and noticed some double vision in my left eye. i go see my optometrist and she suggests i see a neurologist. i wanted a second opinion so i went and saw an ophthalmologist. after being seen 3 times by 2 different doctors i was diagnosed with keratoconus. i was given a pamphlet with information, told to look into sclerals, and was sent on my way. fast forward 2 months and $1600 later i have sclerals. i hated them and couldnt even get them in right. so i just used my glasses for the most part. my right eye still had 20/20 with glasses at this point. that didnt last very long. about 3 months later around july i start noticing double vision in my right eye as well, although a lot less severe. it was pretty clear it was getting worse fast. so here i go to new doctor that specializes in crosslinking. i get all the tests done and find out i'm a great candidate due to the cornea still being about 495 microns thick. they give me pricing information and even set a tentative date. it felt like i was being sold on it without much info. here is a disclaimer. do not trust the internet and strangers on everything. instead use it as a tool. thats what i did when i started looking into going to canada for cxl + prk. i was not happy with how the doctors treated me and my situation here in texas. it felt like i was just another patient who didn't matter. i called around to the major clinics that did this, lasik md, plec, etc. i finally decided on plec after doing a lot of research. the dr. there had not only good reviews but the experience and knowledge to do it. every other individual doctor i looked into was far less experienced from what research i did. so off i go and set up the appointment to get this done. all i had to do was send in my scans and they confirmed i was a candidate. i fly there on a monday for the initial consultation and some more scans. tuesday one last test. i got to see vancouver which is absolutely beautiful. wednesday my wife flew in and i had the procedure done. the next day i went back for a check up and friday we flew out. i wont go into detail about the pain and irritation of the first day. there are enough posts about that. the first 2 weeks are very rough and i recommend you take them off from work or school. after that it starts to get better. so here we are. 6 months later and my dominant right eye is sitting at 20/15 vision. its never been better and it's pretty much stabilized. my left eye which was much worse is sitting somewhere around 20/40 or 20/50. they are putting me back on some prescription drops to see if the left eye improves a bit. overall the experience of the surgery is something i hope never to repeat. the pain and light sensitivity are pretty damn bad. the blurriness is horrible. the money spent is quite a lot at least for me. i would do it all over in a heartbeat though. i have better vision now than before with no current signs of progression. i dont have anxiety over possibly not being able to drive. the doctor and entire staff at plec were and continue to be great. they still check on me and my tests once my optometrist sends them in. shout out to my optometrist as well she has been great through all of this. i'll continue getting my check ups when necessary and hopefully i wont ever need another round of cxl. to anyone going through this right now. there are options and there is light at the end of the tunnel. my path may not be right for everyone. i suggest you talk to your doctors. get a second opinion if you feel you need one. do all the research you can and if you have a good doctor trust what they say. feel free to ask any questions you might have.",reddit,1,1

8988,"hi there, i am 32 and was told i have me/cfs 2 years ago. however, i believe in my case this is the sjogren's causing all the fatigue. to complicate everything, i was also diagnosed with graves disease in august and already had hashimoto since 2009... your symptoms could point up to a flare yes. i am currently experiencing one which started 3 weeks ago. the smoke in the air and extra stress were triggers. the best things to do are to rest, take high quality fish oil (for me it works to calm down the inflammation in my lower back but everyone reacts differently to medication so you would want to talk to your rheumatologist first.) the dryness in the mouth and eyes has gradually worsened since 2018. i have seen an ophthalmologist 2 weeks ago who agrees that it looks like sjogren's, as my tear production is abnormally low and i also have very dry mouth. i have talked to 2 different rheumatologists since may. the first one told me i am tired because i have cfs... the second one doesn't take a stand concerning sjogren's. he first said it's highly likely as i have moderately elevated ana antibodies and all my symptoms, but then changed his mind at the next call, only to change his mind again at our last phone call and said :""it could still be sjogren's."" i know i have sjogrens and am lucky my new ophtalmologist agreed with me and sent a letter to the rheumatologist. the rheumatologist refuses to give treatment other than pilocarpine for saliva production. my insurance doesn't cover it so i can't try it as it would cost around $300/month (canadian dollars). he also said that plaquenil won't help with the deep fatigue. i have had to quit working since 2018 and i really want to have a better quality of life. i have also read about the potential retinal toxicity of plaquenil which sounds scary. however, i would love to have the option to try it and see if after 6 months it starts helping with the fatigue. i will probably have to see third rheumatologist (and run the risk of being seen as ""doctor shopping."" i wish you all the best, whichever road you choose and hope you feel better soon.",reddit,1,1
8990,"i've had this issue for as long as i can remember (i'm 20 now). i had a mri before covid but they didn't see anything (they looked for tumors or excess pressure). an ophthalmologist looked at the scan too and said everything looked pretty much normal. apparently i have a slightly narrow optical nerve though, not sure if that's relevant. an optometrist once offered some fancy prism lenses that are apparently supposed to help but my insurance doesn't cover them. i've moved states since covid started and no one's taking new patients except for really basic stuff. most recent glasses prescription: od: sphere: -5.50, cyl: -0.5, axis: 159 os: sphere: -5.50, cyl: -0.25, axis: 166 distance: 62.0 i can still see up close with glasses on but eventually i'll get a migraine. there's a space from about 4 inches from my face to about 1.5 feet away that'a really hard to me to focus in. this is because it's too far away for me to see without glasses but too close to see with them. nothing's blurry, but sometimes letters overlap or double. this makes it really hard to wear contacts because the same thing happens, only i can't take my contacts out every time i want to read. is there anything i can do to stop this from happening? is there a name for this? my brother, sister, and dad all have the same thing but me and my sister have it the worst. edit: some more info: my migraines are pretty severe usually. i sometimes get nauseous and throw up and usually have to lie down for an entire day. if i manage to notice it before it gets bad i can reduce the severity by taking painkillers (acetaminophen) and not focusing on anything within 6 or so feet. my migraines have a sharp pain between/slightly above my eyes. the migraines started around three years ago and have very slowly increased in severity and frequency, although i've gotten better at managing them. it affects my life because i'm a developer and i have to read text on a screen all day. this increases my chances of accidentally getting too close to the screen and getting a migraine. if i get a migraine i can't work because focusing on small stuff like works hurts really bad.",reddit,1,1

9000,"a few years ago i began having slight issues with my vision. at first it was just that with certain headlights ( i think the newer led ones) i would see a duplicate set of headlights underneath it but in blue. it literally looks like they installed a separate set of headlights right under the first but in blue. initially it was only when i looked out the side of my eyes but has since become an all time thing. then came the motion blur with anything lit up in a dim room. a remote, my phone, whatever had any glow to it will leave a very slow light trail behind it. then came motion blur with anything white. flipping through a book, wiping something with a paper towel etc. then the colors that shouldn't be there showed up. usually it's purple ( when looking at an all white spot like a field of snow, or at a red light a purple haze will be under the red glow) but sometimes is blue. also when i look across anything lit up a flash of light goes the opposite way. if theres a candle for example and i look to the left of it, i will immediately get a flash of light going to the right. i have recently begun seeing random flashes of purple in my peripheral vision. i also have motion blur now with pretty much anything. my own hands ( i'm a brown skinned person so they're not white at all) and anything i move with them. i also now struggle to see white lit things like the captions on television which now also have a blue outline, and the time on my stove. i also struggle with getting my brain ro let go of an image it has seen. a lot of times it's the pattern of the brake lights from the car in front of me , sometimes 10 minutes after i have seen them. i have eye drs who listen and examine me thoroughly but see nothing wrong with my eyes. in the past year my vision got blurrier and it seems like every thing would be fine if there was just more light. i did get a new prescription and am waiting for the glasses to come in so maybe that will help with the blurriness but it's been odd. also when i'm looking at my phone what looks like a negative image of what i'm seeing flashes to the side of my screen. and today the sun was high on the right upper section of my vision but i saw a dark spot the same size as it on my left as well. i am 36 years old. i have a family history of macular degeneration and i myself have somewhat controlled diabetes. i get diabetic eye exams yearly. no visual damage is there. i recently tried seeing a new dr who gave me a test to check how things were with my brain since my eyes seem fine. she sat me in front of a screen with a wire on my scalp and had me watch a tv screen of black and white images. she said the results came back as me having "" a delay"" but won't say what that means only that she wants to talk to my neurologist. . this has been several weeks of anxiety and worrying and i still have no answers because she keeps forgetting about me. of importance , probably, is the fact that i have had 3 mris over the years to check for ms because of odd sensations and muscle movements that are otherwise unexplained. all have come back unremarkable, the most recent a few months ago. it was ordered because in december of 2019 i developed nearly non stop twitching in my eyes and the muscles surrounding them. the twitching eventually spread to my cheeks and lips and has calmed down most everywhere now except my eyes, both of which have fluttering anywhere from right below my eyebrows to my under eye area. it's happening nearly continuously although it's only sometimes visible . the only sites i can find about the test i had showing a delay basically said it's a clear indication of ms. while i definitely don't want ms , if that's where this is heading after all these years of "" is it or isn't it"" then i definitely want to know and to get any meds i can to slow progression. but even when i looked into ms visual symptoms nothing i have been going through seems to be mentioned minus the blurred vision which may be age related regression. all this said.. does anyone have any suggestions to what may be going on? i am uncomfortable using my vision as it is but am terrified of it getting worse or losing it. could this be ms? something else? any advice or ideas would be great, google is not my friend but is coming up empty handed anyway.",reddit,1,1
9001,i'm -5.0 myopic in both eyes and i'm now 36. my vision got bad enough to need glasses when i was about 12 and it got steadily worse until i was in my twenties. but then it settled down and my prescription rarely changes much these days. when you've stopped growing your prescription should settle down a bit. i don't believe there's any research which shows that wearing corrective lenses has a big impact on future vision. most people's myopia is down to the shape of the eye rather than usage. of course when you get older you'll experience changes in your comfortable reading distance but that'll be down to your age and the reduced flexibility of the lens in your eye. but that's a different thing to being short-sighted. so don't worry. with your level of short-sightedness and your age i very much doubt it will get too much worse.,reddit,1,1

9023,"i've been a uncontrolled diabetic for a few years. i finally bit the bullet and went into the doctor to get it under the control. initial a1c was 13, now its 9.7 and falling after 2 months. working on diet and exercise and trending in the right direction. still have shame for letting it get this far, but i cant change the past. i'm 47m. i went into the optometrist to get a checkup. i had lasik back in 2000, now i have slight nearsightedness and i wear progressive bifocals. no vision complaints, but i went to check it out. doctor saw some diabetic changes in the eye (non-proliferative), and asked me to see a retinal specialist to monitor. i made an appointment for january. three days later, i woke up with redness, crustiness and as the morning progressed, \*severe\* pain whenever any light changes. like a stabbing in my head. i was down for the count. got in the next day, diagnosed with uveitis and put on steroid drops and a drop to dilate my eyes. pain went away almost immediately, although my vision continued to be wonky - i assumed because of the dilating drop. checked in with the optometrist, and when i complained about the vision he did another retinal scan and noticed changes from just a few days before. i got into the retinal specialist on a priority basis . he said that i have macular edema, which is causing my blurred vision in my left eye. however, he couldnt ascertain if it was diabetic related or related to the uveitis (or if i already had some edema before, and the addition of the uvetitis caused my vision changes). he initially wanted to do a dye study to study the blood flow (not sure exactly what), to apparently help him determine a course of action. when i couldnt do it right then, he put me on on toradol (generic) drops, and asked to come back in a week. i'm due to go back in a couple of days, which will be 2 weeks from that sudden onset uveitis. some questions i have (for him, of course, but wondering if anyone wanted to chime in): 1. the sudden onset of it is weird. is it possible that something in the eye exam unwittingly triggered it? the dilation drops? or maybe trauma from me rubbing it because of the dilation? 2. i'm going to get worked up for autoimmune disorders next time i see my primary. but from what i understand, if its just the one time it's often idiopathic? 3. will more time on steroid/nsaids be worth trying before any sort of injectable or other treatment? frankly, i freaked out (silently) when i got my lasik and i'm leery of the idea of injectables. (if i have to, i have to, of course). if there's a risk to waiting, though, i'll get what i need to done. 4. what value does the dye study have diagnostically? 5. is there a chance that the relatively rapid decline in my a1c/sugar levels can cause something like this? i read anecdotally that doing so can cause retinopathy to flareup. if so, whats the likelihood that this will fade with time? is there a way to determine if this is the case? i appreciate any insight or experience you care to share. thanks!",reddit,1,1

9197,"i'm now 19 yrs old, i was diagnosed when i was 15, i had first just noticed that i could not see the whiteboard in school anymore so i asked my mom to see about glasses for me. when they tried to get a reading on my cornea to get the correct numbers for my glasses they were unable to and recommended that i see a specialist. so a specialist i saw , my mom took me to a university that has an opthamaology dept. and they suspected i have kerataconus but they recommend i just start wearing scleara lenses , my mom rightfully saw this as putting a bandaid on an infection that requires treatment. we then went to a specialized eye institute with an experienced opthmalogist that has seen my condition before. he recommended i not wait and get the cross linking procedure done on both eyes asap bc my left eye was progressing very quickly for my age and my right was slower but still progressing. so within 2 months i got both cross linkings. this was not covered by insurance and came straight from my (single) mom's pockets (god bless her for that). thankfully my keratoconus has not progressed at all since and i'm now 19 , i have been wearing my hard sclera lenses every day since i got them. it was extremely difficult for me at first to get them in and out using the plungers .now they have become part of my daily routine i barley think about it and get them in within a minute every single time. so overall i felt cursed with this condition for a long time and it made me very depressed that i had such awful vision when i wasn't wearing contacts but honestly things could be much worse at least i don't have some disease that will kill me!",reddit,1,1

9239,"i was in middle school when i started having a hard time reading, glasses didn't work, i was in 8th grade when i was diagnosed. i spent a lot of time trying different contact lens' and in senior year i had my first cross linking procedure. it didn't improve my vision much, but we were just trying to stop the progression. in college i made it through, but i could feel my eyes getting worse. after graduation i had another cross linking procedure, this time a little more aggressive epi-off procedure. only my left eye was a candidate at this time, my right eye wasn't a candidate anymore because the cornea was too thin. i started scleral lens' and this helped me so much! i was comfortable. overall there were just so many times i would have cornea abrasions and have to take time off of school or work. until scleral lens' i always felt uncomfortable. i love reading and felt so much frustration that i couldn't easily do it, it was a chore, only when i got scleral lens' i was able to fill on dive into that hobby. i started a book club, i also started studying to go back to school and become a nurse. i have always loved studying and having keratoconus has given my an extra challenge to push through, it's so frustrating that not many people could understand. it made me feel like i was complaining a lot, like i didn't have a right to complain, people wear contacts and it's normal... but with me there was pain, and a grave uncertainty of my future. as a nurse i work 12 hour shifts, and when the pandemic started i picked up extra shifts to help out at the hospital. long hours strained my eyes, and i started getting corneal abrasions again. eventually i went to see a cornea specialist because my abrasions persisted and i found out it was actually corneal hydrops in my right eye - i needed a cornea transplant. i remember finding out and getting panic attack in the office, having to numb myself with xanax when i got home so i could fall asleep. this had always been my fear, what i was trying to always prevent. it made me feel so trapped to this disease. i am still recovering from the transplant. i've been out of work for a month now, i couldn't work with corneal hydrops and now i'm still waiting for clearance to return. i've been really depressed this summer, it's been a hard mental battle. i've had to alter my travel plans, life plans of moving to a new city, and sit in isolation healing because i'm terrified of getting covid during my recovery. this is a pain and a struggle that's hard for most people to understand. mostly it does unnoticed by other people. i am angry, i am sad, sometimes i am hopeless. however, i know that all i can do is ride the wave. i pray that one day it stabilizes. i pray that this transplant is a positive experience, that it lasts for as long as possible. day by day, that's how i have to think about it, or else i easily start crying and get overwhelmed. however, i will say keratoconus has never stopped me from pursuing my goals. i have traveled many places and done backpacking trips in south america and europe. i have studied and pursed academics taking it one day at a time, i think having to sit close to the front of the class to see the board helped me graduate with high honors. i have continued reading even during recovery periods by switching to audiobooks. driving a car can sometimes be hard when i have periods of complications so i try to live in a city or neighborhood where i can walk to most places, this helps me always keep independence. it's hard, there are definitely moments when i feel so depressed. i just try to remind myself of all the things i've been able to do in life, i try to not even think about the future too much because all i can do is make sure i am doing everything i am in the present moment. i am 26...i'm feeling a little exhausted by the work, but i'm not ready to give up.",reddit,1,1

9328,"i was diagnosed 5 months ago on routine checkup, i did not even realize i had anything wrong with my eyes. in reality i couldn't even read a screen with my right eye (with glasses on). my opthamologist said since i'm 30 and not 16 , progression could've stopped. he also said hes more of a cornea transplant proponent over laser surgeries so i should just come back in 6 months for a follow up. since then i have read all about cxl and how it's the only way to stop progression besides posisbly by age. i read about ghosting and astigmatisms here too but since i did not have those symptoms and i'm 30 i figured maybe it would stop on its own. i also figured either way i was going to need special lenses to see better out of my right eye. i felt no rush to stop progression with a scary laser surgery. **what i didn't realize was my sight would get so bad i would need contact lenses to read everything, even my cell phone.** until recently i could always read things like my texts or books without glasses but now i get really bad ghosting so now i cant see near or far.. what truly is alarming is how bad this ghosting progressed in a manner of weeks. i know my right eye has been much weaker than my left eye for over 3 years so i feel like ive had it that long. the scary thing is, it has only taken 2 months for me to not be able to read close screens. **i believe it has to do with stronger prescription sunglasses given to me by the same dr.** after i was diagnosed. what frustrates me the most is he even said i wouldnt even suggest stronger prescription glasses because it might mess with your brain. i respected that but i then needed an updated prescription to get sunglasses. even if i needed lenses, i needed something to help me see till then. i explained in an email that although he suggested not increasing it i still needed a newly signed one even if it was my old prescription, but he gave me the stronger one. i kind of noticed that whenever i used my sunglasses it got worse but now i'm sure after a sunny week, my ghosting has been worse than ever. sorry for the tangent but i think it needs to be explained better in this subreddit. if you arent experiencing ghosting yet, maybe try to beat it. **i didn't realize it can get to a point where you always need your contacts to read , in a manner of weeks.** so if you can still read your cellphone without contact lenses, maybe try to be proactive and visit many doctors. now i think i might never be able to read well without contacts in and that might make a huge difference in quality of life. i have that follow up appointment on tuesday and im not sure why im even going, i know i need cxl now. **if anyone has suggestions for a laser surgeon in nyc, it would be much appreciated **.",reddit,1,1

9464,"hi, i had a posterior vitreous detachment at the age of 25, which resulted in having an epiretinal membrane as well. it never caused me any issues and was only spotted by the optometrist at a regular eye check. i realized later that a black dot floater i was seeing was probably this. i hardly ever noticed it though. however, i'm 35 years old now, and i've just had another posterior vitreous detachment which i don't think has fully detached yet as the jelly is flashing every time i blink. i don't mind too much if i get an eye floater, i can live with that, but i'm getting anxious knowing that i could keep getting many more pvd's throughout my life and knowing that every time it occurs, there is a risk of a retinal tear or detachment. i know its been 10 years since my last one, but i'm guessing it could become more regular as i get older. i don't have myopia and have never understood why i started getting these so early on. or perhaps i am worrying too much? i thought i read somewhere that it can only only happen once in one eye, but i guess that is not the case. thanks for your help.",reddit,1,1

9469,"i'm going to try to keep this as brief and relevant as possible, but so far there is a lot to cover. i will try to keep it chronological as well. **january 2010 (17 years of age)** \- optic nerve ""swelling"" noticed on routine exam. mri done to rule out iih. mri was normal, more images taken. optic disc drusen diagnosed in right eye only. at the time, they were ""buried"" drusen and were not considered significant. told at the time to monitor yearly by doing a visual field test at each eye exam and self-monitor for changes in color vision. **2010 - 2019** \- i do mostly yearly visits, give or take some months, and receive normal results on my tests. periodic imaging it taken and drusen is still, as far as anyone told me, normal and not significant. my most recent imaging and test were 2019, which as far as i am aware were normal. color vision is normal. **2020** \- testing is skipped this year for obvious reasons **early/mid july 2021 (29 years of age)** \- i start to notice in early july that the vision in my right eye seems off, but not in terms of distance. i cannot quite put my finger on what is off about it, just noted i cannot see as well. in mid-july, i realize that i am not able to see as well in my peripheral vision in the upper nasal portion. i self-test for difference in color vision between two eyes and notice that i am seeing everything in a significantly more warm/orange tone in my right eye than with my left. i call and make an appointment with a new ophthalmologist. **late july 2021** \- at the new doctor, lots of imaging is done as well as a humphrey visual field test. the images showing the optic nerve head showed ""very significant"" drusen in the right eye and only a small amount on the left. he estimated that due to how much there is, it is contributing to the loss of peripheral vision to a degree. one of the images (i don't know the name but [this is the type]( of image) showed a lumpy/bumpy appearance, which i understand to be normal with my level of drusen. it shows what looks like some fluid on the right one, which he notes but doesn't think is important. the visual field test showed a significant amount of visual field loss on the nasal side. my last visual field test from 2019 was faxed over from my previous doctor and was completely normal. due to the progression and the sudden nature of my vision loss, he referred me to a neuroophthalmologist. **late august 2021** \- i have the appointment with the neuro. more imaging is done as well as another humphrey visual field test. the imaging returns the same results, but the visual field test showed slight improvement, though my vision was still affected to a degree. my iop was 23, but my corneas are quite thick, so when adjusting for that it would have been around an 18. she did not believe that there was anything neurological going on and that it is likely loss from the drusen. she think it could potentially be from migraines and suggests an mri if i'm worried, but she doesn't think one is necessary. i decline an mri at that time because if she isn't worried, i'm not worried. we make a follow-up appointment for late november to check my visual field again and note any changes or worsening symptoms. **late august - early october 2021** \- my vision stays about the same for a week or two, but then gets significantly worse. i have tunnel vision in the right eye all day, accompanied by sharp, stabbing pain in the eye. my vision is also now blurred. i notice occasional pain/pressure in the eye as well. the next day, my vision is back to my normal. there is no clear pattern happening, but i have days where my vision is ""normal"" and other days where it's not. i almost immediately start keeping track of symptoms and activities to find any correlation. i make an appointment with me regular eye doctor just to update my prescription, as i believed it had changed and with everything else, that got put to the side at the time. in late august, i cut out caffeine and stopped taking my prescribed adderall to see if there would by any improvement in symptoms. **today** \- i go in for my normal eye exam. my prescription is exactly the same, though i mention my symptoms to him, and mentioned today was a ""good vision"" day. he decides to do more imaging, though doesn't really mention why, and takes my iop which was 22. the imaging shows a choroidal nevus in the right eye, as well as a chrpe. he mentions that with the symptoms and the fluctuations i've reported, he believes that i should go ahead and have the mri. he also says that it's possible that the nevus is leaking fluid, which can cause vision loss as well. he does not think that it is being caused by migraines as the other doc suggested. he encourages me to reach out to my neuro doc to see if she can see me any earlier than november 30th and asks that i update him if possible. i reach out via the messaging system and hear back fairly quickly. she does not think an mri is necessary, but she is willing to order one if i want. she says that it's incredibly unlikely for my nevus to be causing any issues or leaking fluid. she now believes that my vision problems are caused by a combination of ocular migraines and the drusen. she recommends i cut back on caffeine and switch to a different adhd medication. i have already completely stopped both of those things as of late august. she recommends i start keeping a log of my symptoms and recording my stress levels, caffeine intake, sleep amount and quality, and any high-sodium/high-msg, dairy, and sugar intake. i write back to let her know that i had cut out caffeine/stimulants all together, and that i had been keeping track of sleeping patterns and quality and found no correlation. i also let her know i have never had any known issues with ocular migraines in the past and asked if it was normal for them to start quite suddenly. she wrote back and mentioned that she still believes it's highly likely to be ocular migraines, and asks me to keep track of the other items as well. she said it's not unheard of for these to begin suddenly. she mentions she will still see me as scheduled on november 30th, but doesn't believe it is neurological in nature and i will likely need to follow up with my regular doc or my pcp. i reach out to my regular doc to let him know that she believes it to be due to migraines and not something neurological, and give him the updates. he says he disagree entirely, and wants me to either reach out to the other doctor in the department or get a second opinion from a different referral. (i should mention, this is not costing me anything to get the mri or see another doctor, as i've already met my deductible for the year, so both are very doable). at this point, i am really quite unclear about what's causing this or where to go from here. one doc recommends an mri, one is saying it's not needed but she'll order one if i really want her to. one is telling me it really doesn't seem like migraines, the other is telling me that's probably what it is. i'm inclined to go with whatever the neuro says, as with that being her specialty, it seems she would be more likely to know what to do. however, i am hesitant to think that this is just migraines being caused by something like msg or sugar or some other life factor that i've been exposed to my entre life when i have never had any issues like this before. i am really at a loss for what to do from here.",reddit,1,1

9500,"for the past month or so, i was noticing a flash of light out of the corner of my peripheral every now and then. like a small starburst would pop up on a dim or darkened wall, sometimes while i was in the shower. this isn't new as it had occurred on occasion a few years ago and i was given a dilated exam and told my retinas were fine and not to worry, things should clear up on their own. i never really had any more issues since then, maybe noticing a little flash here and there afterwards, but not very often to the point of forgetting about it. as stated before, the flashes were coming back again and i was seeing them almost every day for about a month. same starburst pattern out of the corner of my eye. i started getting worried reading about what it could mean, but before i could get around to making an eye appt they stopped for a few days. my worry continued however about what was happening and i decided i'd call if they came back. then i began seeing different types of flashes. smaller, like little specks resembling glitter that would pop in and out of my vision every few minutes, even if i was just still, staring straight ahead. so i started panicking and made an appointment which i had today. i explained everything that had been going on with the flashes and requested a dilated exam to check my retinas but everything came back fine. my eyes look structurally healthy, yet the frequent glitter effect and occasional brighter flash continue, seemingly from both eyes. my optometrist explained the glitter sounds like an oxygen deprivation sort of issue and that it could be more related to the brain more than the eye itself as i'm a bit young for a pvd (30 yo). i'm not sure how i could be hypoxic yet have no other symptoms other than the eye flashing. i don't really have any floater issues, my eyes have just been a bit good and sore over the last week with some pulsing and sometimes almost stabbing pain, but it's been getting better. i guessed i'd strained them a bit with all the looking around following all the flashing blips. the optician reassured me that it's nothing serious and should clear up in time. what else could possibly be causing dozens of little flashes a day yet show no sign of retina tear or detachment? i spend way too much time on different screens each day, with the lockdown and all, but i've done so for a number of years and have never had vision issues like this.",reddit,1,1

9770,"i have dealt with redness in the eyes ever since i was 18. i am now 36. i used to see it in both eyes, but the last few years i have only had it in my right eye. it's only on the exposed cornea on the inside corner of my eye, but sometimes it'll be red on the outside. it does seem like that eye is dryer than the other, but i only have very mild discomfort and it doesn't itch. i normally wouldn't post on here, but i have literally seen countless eye doctors over the years. every visit turns out the same. they do a thorough exam and find no signs of infection or any issues whatsoever. so each one gives up and prescribes something like zylet or alrex. i usually use it for a few days only and symptoms disappear for months then eventually come back. most doctors assume it's some allergy. i've tried changing soaps, detergents, everything. being outside seems to make it better some. lubricant drops help for a few minutes but no more. i've tried fish oil, multiple diet changes, and anything i could think of. it definitely seems worse the less sleep i get. if i can get a ridiculous amount of sleep, like 10 hours, it almost completely goes away, but that's near impossible to get that much sleep. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. thank you for your time.",reddit,1,1
9771,"my rheumatologist diagnosed me with behcets syndrome this morning and mentioned eye problems will be a large component. i've had scleritis before but not uveitis. anyone familiar with this disease and have any suggestions? i am going to be seeing my ophthalmologist. to make things more complicated, i also have osteogenesis imperfecta so my sclera is already thin and i have subtle sunflower cataracts. if anyone has any information that they're willing to share, i would appreciate it. 30 year old female if it matters.",reddit,1,1

9779,"just wanted to provide an update in case anyone cares. i'm 25 and i got cxl in one of my eyes so far. 1. vision has gone back to baseline, or very close at least. i would say 95% if its not 100% yet. 2. one side-effect that i still have is haze. nothing extreme but noticeable in certain conditions with high contrast. it's only been 3 months but im hoping the haze goes away in due time. 3. also i noticed starbursts coming from light sources, i'm hoping this goes away as well. 4. dryness has gotten better and i've been using less drops as the months go by. so overall, vision is not bad at all, but some slight haze that i'm praying goes away in time, if anyone else has experience with cxl and can comment on the haze please let me know if i should be worried.",reddit,1,1
9781,"to start out i am 32 and have never had glasses before. i had 20/15 vision prior to being dilated. i recently found out i am hyperopic and need a prescription of +6 in my left eye and +3 in my right eye. my optometrist opted to start out with glasses approximately half strength. i ended up getting fitted for +2.5 and +1. i know it takes a while to adjust to glasses but i am always dizzy if i'm moving and get nauseous pretty easy, especially if i'm looking around at things (ie grocery shopping). my distance vision is definitely worse than it used to be. i have a fish lense view and i struggle to change my focus from near to far and vice versa. i'm wondering how long is normal to wait for things to level out? could it possibly be that my eyes want to fully relax and i should up my prescription or is it because it was a big jump from nothing? also, when i take my glasses off to shower i loose my balance because one eye can accommodate again and one is blurry, haha does this level out? thanks for the help! i also want to get prescription sunglasses so i'm trying to guess how long i would stay at this prescription? i'm outside in the sun a lot and definitely need something.",reddit,1,1
9782,thanks for you useful reply. can an a optometrist detect early on if a high myope is likely to experience issues or not? i'm now 30 and my optometrist always tells me that my retina is healthy. she also advised that macular degeneration is very unlikely for myself as my macular is also in good condition. is this true? does complications related to high myopia always lead to legal blindness or are many complications treatable?,reddit,1,1

9800,"i've read about this being multifactorial , then what about dry eyes due to just prolonged computer use? without any other eye/health conditions? how bad is it in the dry eyes spectrum in comparison to dry eyes caused by other issues? and can they be treated to a point that they no longer progress? i know that it can't be cured or reversed. but what about lifelong treatment? i just don't want it to go from mild to severe. mild dry eyes for my entire life is fine. same way can we manage it? like would taking treatment help ease off symptoms or would we feel pain, stinging and stuff always? as i've seen people on reddit who claim that nothing works for them. i'm really scared about my future as i'm just 18.",reddit,1,1

12003,"social anxiety, hairloss and taking control of life - so here i am again, sitting in front of the computer: red eyes, tired as hell and not in the mood to do anything. it has been like this for the last few days. i have been practicing mindfulness for almost half a year now, and slowly it seemed it was starting to help with my social anxiety. sometimes i could feel ok with being physically uncomfortable. i thought i was finally going to win this battle, life wouldn't be so hard after all. but when things started to look better it happened... my hair started falling. gradually, it started to show. i take a shower and i see hairs on the drain, i pass my hand through my head and i get a few hairs on my hand. my pillow is also not a good sight. shedding everywhere... while my hairline remains exactly the same, my hair is diffused all over the top of my head. i can still look like i have a full head of hair when it's long, but i have cut it short last week and my scalp is visible under lights. i can't tell you how crappy i feel when i look in the mirror and see my scalp, such a terrible vision. i am 22 years old, this is no age to be balding... so basically i have been struggling with this. i went to a dermatologist who said i was balding and prescribed me finasteride and minoxidil. the first one can cause erectyle dysfunction, depression and other terrible things, so i wrote it off immediately. the second one is a liquid that needs to be applied twice a day to be (possibly) effective. it stimulates hair growth but it doesnt really stop the hairloss, and you have to do it forever. once you stop, you lose all the hair you gained. plus, it causes dandruff and can cause face swelling and heartbeat raising. so i really haven't made the decision to go down this route or not. i could shave my head, but it would be quite a shock and i am afraid of what it will do to my anxiety... i am not being able to cope with this. i have been binging through the internet to find information about hairloss and coping with it, but if possible i got even more lost... i tend to do this when i get down, i start searching obsessively about my situation only to find contradicting and excessive information, leading to burnout and frustration. instead of trying to distract myself and do something different, i just stay at home and ""disappear"" for a few days, avoding any plans that could take me out of my comfort zone, trying to fool myself that i am pulling myself back together and will come back stronger. i just find it so hard to take control of my life, to live in the present. i always think that tomorrow will be better and that someday, somewhere else, i will achieve my goals. but i just feel so empty right now... today i refused an invitation to a party and didn't leave the house at all. i feel once again back to square one... and it is hard to grind through these moments and to start all over again. it is hard to feel over and over again that all my progress is gone, that i am once again lonely, carrying all my fears and anxieties against the world, when all i really want is to feel surrounded by friends whom i can call and hangout whenever i want, and to find a loving girlfriend. but that just seems so distant.. any thoughts on this? anyone experiencing something similar? how do you grind through these moments? how do you build a routine and stick to it no matter what, to achieve your goals? and for anyone dealing with baldness how do you cope with it? does meditation help?",reddit,1,1

12006,"i feel like i've wasted my entire life doing nothing because of my anxiety. no, i have wasted it. - i'm 16 and i've never had any real friends, and whenever i was starting to develop friendships with people my anxiety would shut that down instantly and make it incredibly difficult for me to talk to them. i stopped going to school at age 13 because of my anxiety, i was constantly getting panic attacks and cold sweats, i couldn't focus on my work and everything scared me. this got my parents into a lot of legal trouble, and it seriously hurt my relationship with them, but i couldn't take school anymore, it was way too much and i wanted to do anything but school. i wish i could go to school without anxiety, i love talking to people and being with people i love, but my anxiety won't let me, all i can do is fantasize about that. i'm at the point where i've lost all hope, i feel as if nothing will ever change. my daily routine is just me dicking around online and i'm sick of it, it's so boring, but i have nothing else to do. my anxiety is everywhere, i can't get rid of it no matter how hard i try. i've talked about this with my psychologist (i think that's what they're called? the mental health version of a gp) but i find it really hard to talk about any of my problems there, they just run down a list of questions then end it. ''have you had any bad or suicidal thoughts lately? how have you been? so no changes? ok, see you next month''. it's pretty much that, i don't really have a chance to say what i want because i'm getting rushed to finish. i've mentioned smaller thing like adhd and stuff but he didn't really help me with that much. so i don't see asking for help as much of an option, i also don't want my parents to find too much out about myself because it would probably worsen our relationship more. what is there to do anymore, i don't feel like there's anything i can do now, i have no control. i don't want to keep living like this, it's so boring and my emotions have gone numb. i seriously don't want to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing i've done yesterday, i'm so sick of it... if i told my doctor any of this, he'd have to tell my parents, if my parents found out i'm depressed and suicidal and have crippling anxiety they'd treat me with even less respect than they do now, i'm considered a failure, and i agree that i am one, i just don't want them to have more reason to tell me how much i fucked up my life and how ill never have another chance in life. i already know. this has been a really sad post, sorry about that, just wanted to vent a bit. i'm usually a lot more happier sounding. thanks for reading.",reddit,1,1
12010,"i feel extremely out-of-my depth among the upper class in an asian country. you guys have experience with that ""big small town"" feeling and adults who gossip like high schoolers? i'm 22 and new to this. - tl;dr: jumping into a new social class in a new location is stressful i'm in myanmar. arriving here, my initial goal was to settle by making local friends and i find them consistently chill and approachable. meanwhile, the expats are probably a little friendlier than average in north america; they're well-travelled and educated people. among the expats, the lowest social status are transient english teachers and ngo workers. then there are the corporate managers and diplomats, mostly european and worldly. startup and entrepreneur foreigners are increasingly common and i am one. the trouble is that, at this stage, i'm making less money than even the english teachers. among the local young people, the wealthier are the most westernized. typical locals want to be friends with foreigners but the rich kids are like foreigners in their own country. i'm having a fling with one of these internationally-schooled locals, getting a look into the ""expat scene"", and a number of things are stirring up anxiety. in canada i was comfortably middle-class in a city of 1 million people and i'd never experienced anything like ""high school drama"" or whatever prepares you for this type of environment. for example: 1) i don't have the money to keep up with the high society's nightclubs and weekend getaways. i'm always declining invitations so that i can chill with local friends but i actually could not afford to do anything else. 2) the first couple people i slept with here have seemingly been with every white guy in town. i've never even hooked up with anyone with mutual friends before. 3) i had a 5-hour friendly visit with a foreign girl who's been here 7 years; she spilled quite a bit of gossip about various prominent people then blocked+ghosted me afterwards and i've not seen her since. 4) my friend is pursuing this guy who was my girlfriend's high school crush; he's organized various parties and has never acknowledged my existence when i've tried to introduce. 5) i sometimes comment helpful info on questions in the local expats' facebook groups, maybe once per week and multiple strangers have recognized my name. 6) when a wealthy half-white guy heard i was dating my girl, he remarked that i look like ""one of those nobodies who'd move across the world to asia just to feel important"". not super personal, that could be said about almost anyone here, but it still hits close to home lol. you guys have any stories or tips to offer about moving to a new place? ever had newfound notoriety while also feeling inadequate among the well-known people? any insights would be great.",reddit,1,1

12082,"blushing/erythrophobia is incurable, isn't it - my social anxiety stems from my blushing i'm mid 20s and i can't even walk down the street without blushing bright red. i have very very fair skin to make it extra noticeable, and i'm a guy also (less socially ok as it's a feminine trait). and it's psychosomatic because the fear of blushing in itself causes blushing. even though i've tried exposing myself to society a lot over the past 6 months, it hasn't helped it whatsoever. when i get upset by it my muscles tighten and my eyes water along with it. i know it pulls a lot of attention. and there's no rationalizing it. in cbt they try to tell you (essentially) ""it's all in your head"". but in this expression it literally isn't, and i'm self aware enough to recognise that and as such spiral into sadness/suicidality. when i return home from being outside (even this is new to me) i often cry. as far as i know there are no pharmacological cures. some suggestions about using topical ibuprofen, some about beta-blockers (i've tried these and they did nothing for inward or outward anxiety), suggestions of antidepressants which i have tried a dozen of and even things like pregabalin. of course the operation but that costs many thousands and is irregularly performed. benzos are the only drug that help the social anxiety so they are the most effective, but my health service refuses to prescribe these despite my having no history of drug abuse and being completely sober, even being recognised as disabled by the state by this very condition (sa), which has taken so much from me and left me no job, no friends, having never dated at 25 (so pathetic). if you're an outlier in a population from a health standpoint, socialised healthcare is useless. how can a person who is in possession of all his faculties and who is self aware enough to understand how dehumanizing a condition like this is, ever get over it? no matter that i'm coping with my depression - this problem will again and again bring me to my knees and reinforce all negative beliefs every time it occurs.",reddit,1,1

(i think) because of my bad experiences with drugs i developed fear for alcohol, coffee and medicine as well. my therapist noticed it as well and at one day she said it wasnt go to work out, so they decided to let me go. after that, i became in a gap. my fears increased. i developed more fears i already had. i started to avoid more and more. taking the train and bus wasnt possible anymore. doing groceries wasnt possible anymore. especially doing it alone was becoming impossible. i managed to go with someone, but after a while that wasnt possible either. i couldnt get my hair cut anymore. i couldnt hang out with my friends anymore. i couldnt see my family anymore. all of this slowly developed in 1 year till now. at the moment i cant even open my door anymore. i still live at my moms house and i actually have no responsibilities at all. my fears are literally in everything now. i cant watch a movie, because i will fear i lose control and do something evil. im extremely alert and anxious for evil things and its ridiculous. even my hobby; making music, is affected because of it. i cant open my front door anymore, because my social anxiety feel completely overwhelming. if my mom or my sister is away and im alone i feel kinda paranoid. which is something i am fearful for that i have. i feel in constant battle with my thoughts. i am constantly afraid of losing control. that ill snap and do something incredibly stupid. im even fearful of myself. i feel like i have to be constantly alert and it actually goes automatically. im fearful of psychoses. anything that is a little trippy freaks me out. till not long ago i was taking walks everyday, but since that is gone i feel incredibly bad. i feel like i kinda lost myself. i dont who i am under this anxiety. thats freaks me out, because i dont know if its any good. im depressed out the future. i totally not feel connected with the world. physically as well(hard to explain). i just feel completely out of place. everything is just negative. constantly. because its 24/7 i wonder if this is just gad, social anxiety and depression. it makes me insecure. im afraid to expose myself outside of my home. i believe i was born more shy and thoughtful then a regular person, but if i havent go through all of this i dont think i would have suffer this much. i was afraid to sleep alone till an age of 15 for example and i still dont feel comfortable being alone. im 20 years old btw, so i probably have quite some time ahead of me.. and yeah, depressed about the future. i dont see me having a girlfriend, traveling, partying, working, going to school or just having fun in general at all anymore.",reddit,1,1

(i didn't really take much priority over my social life when i was little, i just didn't care. and now i tend to more care on my studies than actually beign social). i remember that whenever i try to talk to girls i just tend to feel akward, out of place, like i dont know what im doing there or what to say. it feels like im just standing there creeply watching everybody talk while i just stand there without saying a word.(because they're normaly talking about stuff wich i'm not really interested in, so i really cant relate to what they are saying.) so i just slowly back up before i even say a word or just i dont even attempt to talk to them, i know it sounds stupid but i just can't bring myself to talk to them, even if some of my friends are there i just feel out of place, almost as if they're speaking antother language. beign an introvert i have very few close friends which enjoy the same hobbies as i do (drawing,memes, and other dumb stuff) so i dont normally learn about new stuff, and i tend to just try to ignore some of the ""highschool drama"" (that will often be what they will be talking about). the only one time that i can acctually remember talking to a girl about something and feeling comftable was when i went to an academic tournament, for once i had something to talk about, something to have in common. she gave me her snapchat, (something which i rarely us, but i appreciated the gesture) i thought i would have a female friend, but as the tournament had ended i just got kind of disconnected, i didnt have anything else to talk about,i tought it would feel odd to talk to her about something else, like she would see me as some kid of creep. i still wanted her to be in touch but once again i just got lost. lastly i would like to say that i tend to overthink things, like when i think about gathering up the courage to talk to a girl, ""will she see me as some kind of creep?"", ""will i look akward?"", "" what does she think of me?"", so many questions that by the time im done thinking either i just decide to not go, or the oportunity has flown out of my grasp. thanks i really needed to get this off my chest, sorry for the nasty mess of a post.",reddit,1,1

12162,"sudden physical symptoms of anxiety. what can i do about it? - i'm 20. since i hit puberty i was always anxious and nervous around people. i would say my peak of anxiety was when i was 14. but now it's somehow getting worse with more physical symptoms. perhaps the first time it happened was when i went on a school sleepover at 15. i got a horrible stomach ache that just wouldn't go away, and i had to go home. but the frustrating thing was that within half an hour of getting back home it disappeared. maybe i was nervous because at the last sleepover i felt completely out of place and isolated while having to share my personal space with other people. i didn't get these stomach aches much for the next few years and couldn't connect them to anything particular. fast forward to 19/20, and some weird shit is happening. on the first day of my new job in the summer. over a period of an hour i got increasingly worsening cramps and nausea to the point where i had to excuse myself to the bathroom and leave my shift. i got even more nauseous in the care and when i got back home i vomited. my stomach ache stuck for the night. i didn't think much of it and thought it was food poisoning from a chicken pie i ate for breakfast that had been left out all night (in summer temperatures). but then it happened again 2 weeks later on my job. it was an extremely stressful and fast-paced day. we were the busiest we'd ever been and i just wasn't coping. i was making too many mistakes and the managers were yelling at me. again over an hour i developed bad cramping and nausea, and at the same time i excused myself and quit my job (the manager was glad). in the car i got even more nauseas. and i did not make it home. i vomited on the sidewalk. but about an hour after i came home everything levelled off and i felt fine. important to note that during that summer i was on birth control that was making me severely fatigued. so i stopped it and tried another one. so for a couple of months i've been involved in a lot of projects and been meeting a lot of people. this is after being isolated for a whole year with my childhood friends slowly dropping over the years or disbanding due to fights. this really messed with my self-esteem where i thought i was just repulsive to people. so least to say i was pretty nervous every time i tried to talk to people. i'm getting anxiety symptoms with some friends but not others. it's those friends that my strict family would disapprove of. i really try to not be nervous. i really make an effort to look forward to the occasion. in my mind i'm thinking: ""i am ready to party, i am ready to have fun. i am having fun."" but i can't help it that every single time i hang out with certain people, i shake the whole time. and then at some point, the stomach ache starts. it might decrease or increase randomly, it might get so bad to the point where i'm very uncomfortable. nausea may start. i felt the threat of vomit when we took a taxi home one time. and it always disappears when i get back home. and then, this is when shit's becoming too much. i got it at my grandparents. my freakin' grandparents. i visit them only occasionally. i don't have a good relationship with them at all, it took a nosedive over the past 3 years, plus they're getting more fragile by the month. i had noticed some visits ago how it's odd that i'm getting tremors. but this time i got nauseas and had to leave. as usual, it passed in about an hour after coming back home. it has to be anxiety. i don't think it's the birth control. i don't know what to do about it. in these situations my mind tells me i'm calm but my body says otherwise. i've been going to therapy on and off for the past 4 years. many of the professionals weren't really good, but i've stuck with the same therapist for more than a year now. so i am getting therapy. i tried an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic, and then in combination, for 6 months in total. and they did nothing. and i really don't want to go on medication because of their side-effects. i know 3 people who took anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication and it completely wrecked them.",reddit,1,1

12236,"hi everyone! new member here! :) - long read :( i'm an asian 23f soon to be 24. a little back story, i've always been the shy, quiet, introverted, normal girl but that all changed junior year of high school after getting bullied for being the shy, quiet and introverted girl lol. a group of kids just got a kick out of how i would react when being put on the spot and they realized if they stared at me long enough throughout class i would become flustered. i blushed easily so what was my solution to that? a lot of make up. i looked like an actual clown. i cringe about it to this day but in my 16 year old head i thought i would rather get made fun of for how much foundation i had than people seeing me turn into a tomato. so that's how my social anxiety happened. i didn't like attention, i didn't like eye contact, i didn't like interacting with anyone for fear of them judging me and witnessing an embarrassing sight. this lead me to overthink everything. i resorted to safety behaviors which meant staying home most of the time but it got bit better when i was 19 years old. my aunt had this store that she needed help running and because she spoke very limited english she pulled my ass in to help. i thought it was a one week thing but i ended up staying there for 4 years. the first year was brutal but as the years went by these interactions came a lot easier. during this time i was able to get my first job as a barista/cashier and get my drivers license. two things i never thought i would be able to do. i worked at a boba shop and it wasn't busy so it was easier to manage and the place was close by so driving there was also okay (i also have driving anxiety...). a year went by and i decided to quit and add to my resume after my cousin referred me to work as a front desk receptionist at an optometrist office. that was probably the worst decision of my life. the work environment was extremely toxic. the people that ran the office micromanaged everything, evaluated you on everything. spoke condescendingly to you and made you feel incompetent...it was hell. i wanted to quite but for my cousin's sake, i didn't want to make him look bad. i was there for about 5 months when the pandemic happened. it was a blessing in disguise for me because it meant a break from all that. i was preparing myself to go back in after a few weeks but it spanned 5 months. i knew they would call me in eventually but thought of going back scared the absolute crap out of me. i eventually got the call and after two weeks of being there i put in my two weeks notice because just as i expected, i couldn't handle it. before, i was able to put up a front and tell my self to stop being a little bitch and to do what i was told to do and leave. not the best coping mechanism but it's what got me through. now, i was now holding back tears in the break room and crying while driving home after every shift. i quit and i focused on school which was still all held online at the time. i couldn't even do an online presentation for one my classes because of how bad my anxiety got. it didn't even require me to turn on the camera, just audio and i couldn't do it. the pandemic that i thought was a blessing in disguise turned out to be the opposite. i feel like from 19-22 i made progress and now i'm back at where i started but this time older and more expectations and pressure from family and society now that i graduated. i also forgot to mention that i dropped two toxic friends along the way. i only have one friend now but we have our issues too. she's understanding and i share a lot with her but...i don't get that closeness like i did with the other two friends. it's weird. i feel alone and i want to make more friends but making friends as an adult is rough and it's even harder when you don't go out and think everyone hates you lol. i actually went to see a psychiatrist yesterday because it was getting a bit much for me. a lot of ruminating thoughts and a lot of questions like, ""how the hell am i expected to live a decent life if i can't do simple things like x, y, and z?"" fear turned into anger and i really don't want to keep living like this anymore. i graduated and i need to get on with life. i need to either find a job or go back to school to pursue higher education. i haven't decided on either yet but the main thing holding me back is my social anxiety. my psychiatrist told me that exposure therapy is what i need to do. i need to embrace that rush i get and become conditioned to get use to doing things like driving, talking to people, doing things by myself, etc. i was also prescribed lexapro, and propranolol. i haven't picked them up yet but he said that these are here to hopefully help kickstart my journey but everything else is willpower and motivation. i can't say i have any of that right now but sharing all of this does help a bit.. if you got through all that, thank you. if not, i understand because this is extremely long lol. anyways, if anyone is like me and needs an online friend i'm here! my main hobbies and interests include kpop and cooking :) \~ i also have a kpop twt account if you feel more comfortable talking there\~",reddit,1,1

12250,"m/23. my life was set up for social failure. i don't know what to do. - context: growing up, because of family issues i switched schools and homes consistently until highschool. i did not have any friends and all i had were videogames, anime and manga. period. no family. no close friends. just those 3 things and an emotionally abusive dad. when i went to college i didn't have time to play games so i dedicated myself to smash as i was able to make friends that way. same thing with anime. i stopped watching for the most part for because of school and stuck to mainly manga. as college passed and i played through the last of the game series i was still of fan, kh and persona, i lost the urge for gaming almost entirely. i didn't really have a driver to play games anymore, at least not if someone didn't tell me what to play as i don't know games or publishers. with anime, that fizzled entirely. the last show i binged was hxh and when i was done i felt as though i wasted a solid 3 days. so the remnants of past only leave me with manga. i still care for manga. i still have opinions but that's all i have. . . . for comparison, and i know i shouldn't be comparing myself to others but i have friends who are into magic, dnd, fanfic writing, queer culture, knitting, art, videogames, and so on. . . but i don't feel like i have anything. . . you can imagine how hard it is to try to converse with others when you literally have nothing to talk about. literally. so being social. having friends. talking to others. caring authentically. it's hard. i unintentionally ghost everyone who interacts with me because i truly have nothing to say. after reading posts on reddit i started basic socialization and anti-anxiety/depression training by going to the gym, dressing better, meditating, journaling and learning very basic conversation etiquette as long as i'm not the focus of the conversation. . . . which. . .makes me not want to talk to people even more because being a wall and only asking questions to keep the conversation going kinda sucks. . . a lot. and a side note: a thought i conceived is that most adults who are not introverted or obsessed/are mega enthusiasts are extroverts because they've socialized enough in their youth to enjoy the presence of others. sooo even though i dropped my introverted hobbies and learned to socialize, i feel as though psychologically acclimated to deriving pleasure around others. i kinda just feel empty. so tl;dr. my youth was basically living in an echo-chamber of games and weeb shit. i've grown to not care for games and anime much so i have literally nothing else to define me. i yearn to simply be able to be around others and genuinely enjoy it . . . . but i can't/it's really fucking hard to make friends if i have nothing to define me/talk about. my life is a catch 22 and i'm sure what the fuck to do.",reddit,1,1

12314,"how much does environment affect your anxiety? - for the past couple of years i haven't been happy. i've spent numerous hours just thinking and pondering and wondering why i no longer feel enlivened the way i used to, many years ago. i'm 21 years old and i'm at a stage in my life where i'm starting to question the meaning of my existence. i've given it a lot of thought and come to the conclusion that maybe it's the place in which i reside that is the source of my mood swings and anxiety. i was born in toronto and am a visible minority. for anyone who has knowledge about the city, it's extremely diverse and teeming with all sorts of ethnic cultures. when i was only 2 years old, my parents, who had lived in the city for almost their entire lives, decided to pack up and move to a little industrial city on the south shore of lake ontario known as st. catharines. i have spent the following years there ever since. toronto is where i feel i belong, and i will elaborate on that below. most of my extended relatives live in toronto. my family had work/personal ties to people living there, and for whatever reason it feels like they were happier living there too. i won't get into all the details but i'm mixed race and visibly appear to be of the visible minority side (half white, half visible minority). st. catharines is a city primarily composed of aging, white, blue collar workers, and there seems to be an air of hopelessness in the city. several years ago, a lot of the larger auto manufacturing plants here closed down when the whole nafta trade agreement came into play, costing people a lot of their jobs. as a result, there are a lot of people here on welfare or barely scraping by, which sort of lends this whole depressing atmosphere to the region. the suicide rate is also one of highest in the country, so i'm apparently not the only one who thinks the whole place is kind of a shit-show. jobs aren't really a thing here either, well, unless you would like to work retail or customer service call centre type jobs for the rest of your life. there's not much of a future here, a lot of the younger folk straight up move away because of the severe lack of good paying jobs. i had the opportunity to move back to toronto a few years ago now and refused to take the opportunity for fear of accruing too much student debt. i've been kicking myself ever since, but that now begs the question: how much does environment really affect one's mood? i'm not talking about personal relationships or how many friends one has, although that also plays a part in all this. i'm talking about demographics and small city living vs urban big city habitation. i enjoy the big city; every time i go back it just feels like home, even though i haven't lived there for most of my life. i feel like i'm missing out on all the action when i stay here, instead of experiencing the vibrancy and liveliness of a larger city. part of it is just the fact that i feel alienated somewhat since i don't fit in with the rest of the population here. people here can be sort of naive, and it doesn't help that the local university has a large international student population that i get lumped into simply because of how i look. it kinda sucks when people don't really think you're a born and bred canadian. so, with all that being said, i think that while moving back to toronto may not cure my anxiety entirely, it would certainly help a lot with my fear of people and interactions, and my unwillingness to go outside (and there's not much to do here anyway) with the exception of going to work/school. it may be expensive, but i feel like it would provide a large boost in quality of life, something i so desperately need at this point. i'm young, i should be out there experiencing new things and learning new ideas. i guess i just have to get over this fear of financially digging myself into an inescapable hole. the anonymity of a big city... it's attractive to me. am i alone in my situation? i'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter. after all, that is why i'm making this post.",reddit,1,1

12347,"i have a physical condition that attracts unwanted attention and it's awful.... - **tldr at the end!** i'm a 22 year old male college student finishing up my senior year, and should be on my way to transition to my professional career as soon as this coronavirus craziness dies down and allows for the amount of travelling the job involves. i'm a movie fanatic, dabble in pc gaming (although i could really use some new hardware), and enjoy most outdoor activities like camping and hiking. i'm 6'1"" and about 170lbs, reasonably athletic, and *try* to dress well. i try to keep my life as average as possible. i don't go out of my way to seek attention, usually i'm happy to just do my own thing and let others do their. well, life decided that was too much to ask for and decided to throw me a curve ball. ever since puberty kicked off, i've been developing into a man at a rate of about 1/16th of an inch a month.... go ahead and reread that, fire up your calculator, whatever you need to do. my doctor can't find anything medically wrong with me, and all my blood work checks out. as far as he can tell this is just how i am. he's prepared me for the possibility that things may not slow down or stop until my mid-20s, although this would be rare. but op! that sounds like an absolute blessing and a dream come true for hundreds of people!! you should be thankful!! yeah well... it was fun at first, but when you have to wake up every day and face the world, all sorts of things get inconvenient very quickly. there a dozens of issues i have to manage that most people don't seem to have to think about. buying clothes is a nightmare. exercise is uncomfortable. sex and dating is a disaster. and the big one... society and people in general. society loves, *loves*, ***loves***, to obsess over this topic. guys brag to anyone who will listen, truthful or not. girls brag to their friends. jokes are made everywhere. media, especially music, won't shut up about it. all sorts of products promising to give you one are marketed universally. there are even categories of videos online dedicated to it. ...and yet it is still a taboo topic to seriously discuss with nearly anyone, at least in the usa. no one seems willing to accept it may not be the most wonderful thing to ever happen to a person. but you won't even get that far because no one will believe you in the first place if you bring it up. i've been harassed, groped, ogled, sneakily photographed, lost friends, dumped or refused by partners or potential partners, and caught in the middle of drama all because of it. i hate the attention it brings. but people are so stuck on the idea that it is a wonderful thing and can't possibly have any downsides that i've yet to find a single trustworthy person who's given me the time of day and just listened to me or let me rant or wanted to try and understand what i go through. so i just bottle it up inside and try to move on with my life and pretend it isn't a source of anxiety for me. **tldr: i've grown about 1/16th of an inch (yes...there) a month since puberty started (i'm 22 now) and it's more of a curse than a blessing. society disagrees with me on that so the stress and issues it creates for me get bottled up inside, which isn't healthy for my mental state and makes me feel like an outsider, freakshow, whatever you wanna call it.** so... thanks for making it this far and if you'd like to ama then please do. honestly anything, as long as it's respectful and genuine, will help take some of this stress off my shoulders at this point. i guess i'm just looking for advice on how to move on past this hang up in my life? i have no idea how to handle this in a positive manner that doesn't result in fucking up relationships with friends, family, and partners. it just doesn't seem like something most people are willing to give the time of day and legitimacy to. it's incredibly frustrating as well because as an introverted person, **i don't want the attention.** this has become a pretty major source of anxiety in my life and i have no idea how to avoid it.",reddit,1,1

12382,"looking for help. - i've always thought of reddit as the place you go when you're looking for feedback from a group of people familiar with your field, i'm not sure how factual that is or if i'm inadvertently posting my problems to people who don't care or aren't interested. i'm just struggling in my current situation and i'm looking for help, and this just seems like a good way to get unfiltered input. sorry if this isn't what i'm supposed to be posting or seems rude in anyway, i'm ignorant and desperate. i've been struggling with social anxiety and depression for my entire life, and i've been seeking medical help for the past 5 years (im 21 now). i cant function properly because of this, my subconscious just tears me apart in most situations. nothing in particular triggers this, im just constantly uncomfortable outside of my room. i lose jobs because customers get aggressive and i start crying, i cant use the bathroom when my roommate is home so i have to wait until the next day for them to leave, im completely incapable of making friends or forming relationships. its just hell, i dont know how else to put it. i cant support myself or pursue things im passionate about, and ive been trying so hard and in every way i can for years to fix this. talking to people is just a constant mental battle of dont give them a reason to hate you, im saying and doing whatever i can to make that person like me more. all the while im sweating everywhere, my arms are shaking and my legs feel like jelly, and im too busy overthinking things to form coherent thoughts and struggle to speak without stuttering. afterwards im full of regret and upset at myself for whatever minute thing i might have done to offend them, or how poorly i performed doing a very basic human task of having a conversation. im very self aware of this and it makes trying to continue pursuing these social interactions so discouraging. my doctors have diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and social anxiety, and ive been prescribed every medication under the sun including controlled substances, none have lessened the effects. ive seen and stopped seeing 5-6 therapists now and all therapy seems to do is ruin whatever day my appointment is on. i've tried most common coping skills and practice some myself to help maintain functionality in stressful environments, but the collapse is inevitable. ive only been able to successfully cope with weed and self harm; weed is illegal in my state and while i have my own thoughts on self harm id like to stop it in time. my main concern is not being able to support myself, people have suggested that i sign up for disability, which i guess is what im doing now. i hate the idea of someone sending me money because i cry too much, just makes me feel shitty knowing theres people out there that would kill for my life. ive worked in it, retail, fast food and sales and every one of them have ended with me crying in front of a customer and asked to leave or just stressing too much about the work to step foot in the door again after a bad day. in the past few months ive been trying to find ways to make money from home like selling game goods or freelance audio/video editing on fiverr but this isn't nearly sufficient enough. im in school for netsec and im hoping to land a job i can work from home in the future, but i dont have a lot of confidence in things turning out ok. its so discouraging to push for so long and see no improvement, and all i can do is rinse and repeat. now we get to chapter 2, the depression. i dont want to get too much into it because you can likely fill in the blanks and theres no sense complaining about it, but the gist of it is if i cant support myself or make friends or do anything outside of sitting in my room and crying, what do i do with my life? this is constantly running through my mind, just hating myself because i cant get basic things done in life and being disappointed at the results. i dont know what to do or try at this point, as i stated currently im signing up for disability but im not confident my request will be granted. im researching electroconvulsive therapy because i dont know what else to do, and im going to start asking my doctors for controlled substances. i obviously dont want to get addicted to anything or see long term health issues, but like i said weed has helped so sedation = good i guess. any and all input is helpful and greatly appreciated. thank you.",reddit,1,1

12482,"yeah, thanks. i suppose that's true. back then i was sooo scared of being locked up or something because i was convinced that i was crazy in the head. i had intrusive thoughts, paranoia and lots of other symptoms that all point to ocd and anxiety, but i was too afraid to share it with my child psychiatrist. the same goes for my depression and recurring suicidal thoughts. i thought that they'd have put me in a straitjacket if they found out about it lol. maybe they actually would have. guess i'll never know. anyways. it's too late now (i'm over 18) to use my child psychiatrist as a reference and way in to the adult ward. up until 18 i was promised (an offer that has now expired) a fast lane if i ever felt a need to talk to someone. but, not knowing the potential consequences of making that call, i hesitated and now i'm here - 19 y/o, severely depressed and on the road to self destruction, physically and emotionally. sigh. there's really no other option for me but to go the regular route and get myself in the back of the long line. it will take years, sure, but i suppose it's better to put myself on the waiting list sooner rather than later.",reddit,1,1

12486,"do women's tastes change in men as they get older?(23f) - i (23f) have an ex(25m) we dated in high school. he was considered one of the most popular seniors. he always went out to parties and had girls. he would always brag on social media, and in-person, he was an ass hole but that people should get used to it. he always brags about being sarcastic and being the center of attention. he was two years older than me, and he is 25 now. he used to get a ton of women when he was younger. he would brag about it and use women for sex and say he has no respect for sluts even though he tries to sleep around. he was in the military, but now in college, but he still drinks regularly and posts multiple pictures drinking on social media. his leading friend group is people from high school who were considered popular. when he was younger, tons of girls wanted to date him, but it seems now that a lot of women block him or unfollow him. also, now when he meets new women with his friends, they are disinterested in him. he even for bad eye bags now from drinking heavily. when i was younger, he told people not to say to people i talk to him because i was unpopular and would call me weird and annoying. he would ignore me after sex said i'm only suitable for sex. don't worry, i moved on and blocked him. now he begs for us to talk again or acts closer than we were. i am asking to see me even with a girlfriend until i block him. i know it's because he has fewer options now of women leave him sooner. why do women not want him anymore? why does this guy put women off promptly at 25 but not 18? how did women's tastes change? tl;dr: i have an ex that would always take pride in being an asshole. he used to get lots of dates, but women seem not to take interest anymore. what changed?",reddit,1,1

12494,"how to talk to girls/other people - hello. i have social anxiety and anxiety as well as slight depression and its been starting to become a big issue in my life so i'm looking on reddit for some help. first off i have to say i've had anxiety basically since i was in 3rd grade and it got really bad in 6th grade, started taking zoloft and over time that started to help and eventually i felt fine. fast forward to 2007 where i lived in a not so great environment with my mom, brother, and my moms friend as her roommate. there was a lot of differences between myself/brother and my moms roommate and eventually it got to a point where we just needed to get out of that hell hole as my brother and i like to describe it lol. we (my brother, my mom, and i) eventually moved in december of 2016 and got an apartment and things have been a lot better in that regards but as for my social anxiety its still a big issue. i'm now 23 going to be 24 this year and still have never had a real girlfriend. i've talked to a few girls online that i've met in games i've played and had one that i thought was gonna the one. she lived in the same state (roughly 4 hours away), was a cute blonde and we had a lot in common. i messaged her online as well as skyped with her while playing games and eventually i got her number and we started texting all the time. in the morning before work, during work sometimes, after work till we both got on and played games and stuff together, we'd message each other/skype (voice chat) for a while and then she would need to go to bed. she'd always end up texting me like a minute later and we would text like all night. eventually i brought up this lan event i was going to attend and told her she should go. told her we could get a hotel room so you don't have to spend as much and i'd bring a bunch of games like mario kart and whoop her ass lol. she said yes at first but the next day messaged me saying that she was gonna stay with a friend because she would feel more comfortable staying with someone shes met and knows (not that she didn't want to its just that we had never met before) and i understood so i told her that was fine and she said she would still hangout with me and we could play games and stuff. she eventually caught onto me that i liked her like a couple weeks before the event and told me she liked me too but was still also had feelings for her ex and doesnt want to hop into a relationship right away so she said we should get together at the event and spend time together and see how things go. fast foward to the event (2015), we meet and immediately my brain shuts off and i just have like nothing to say. i barely got to talk to her at all that whole weekend unless it was through text because i'm a big puss. :( we hung out a little the last night she was there and that was probably the highlight of the trip. we got some pizza together, watched some hilarious youtube videos together and played a board game with my friend i was staying with and 2 of his friends but it was too late because i got kind of fucked up the second night i was there and started texting her stupid shit i shouldn't have said like ""are we dating?"" etc... i cried for what felt like hours when she said we were just friends and that was by far the worst part of the that whole trip. ever since that happened its been like imprinted in my mind and will never leave me. i was extremely depressed for like 6 months after that trip and her and i eventually stopped talking. i feel like i messed up that so badly that i just cant like forgive myself and i feel like i'm never gonna gonna find anyone like her ever again. she felt like the one but because i'm a socially anxious person i never got to talk to her and i never got to be with her and i never will and that depresses me to the point where i feel like i will never find a girl like her ever again. someone i'm attracted to yet but has a ton in common with me. she felt like she was like a female version of me if you understand what i mean lol. and it just depresses me that i can never talk to her again and i never have another shot with her and i'll probably never find another girl like her ever again. i also started taking a paroxetine hcl (paxil) that my dr prescribed to me after not taking zoloft for probably two or three years about two months ago and that has been helping with the depression and has honestly helped me a tiny bit with my social anxiety but not enough. this is where my problem is though. it's like i can talk to people through text but when i'm face to face (especially if its a girl i'm attracted to/like) my brain just shuts down and i have nothing to say. how do i get over this? are there any techniques or tips that you have that could help me. what do i talk about? anything you have at all for me will be helpful. please and thank you. also sorry for the 1000 word essay lol.",reddit,1,1

12500,"finally talking to my doctor about anxiety today - advice? - i have a doctors appointment this afternoon and i'm going to bring up my anxiety in hopes of maybe getting medication. a little backstory: i've struggled with both social and general anxiety for as long as i can remember...for most of my life i never even knew what anxiety was. i'm 25 now, and back in school they never taught us about mental health, they kinda touched on it, but i always thought the term ""anxiety"" just meant temporary nervousness. i thought i was a nervous person my whole life, then i discovered anxiety near the end of high school, early college. i still haven't gotten help though, but i'm really struggling as the anxiety interferes with my everyday life, my work, my relationships, it holds me back so much. i get irritable, overly stressed, worry about every little tiny problem, and on the physical side i get shaky, i stutter, my throat gets tight, my face turns red and hot, heart rate increases, and if it's really bad i cry and can't speak. anyone who's talked to their doctor about this, can you give me some advice or share your experience? i guess i'm just worried the doctor won't believe me? it seems like everyone has anxiety these days, it's almost like a trend to say you have anxiety and depression so i don't want mine to be written off. i rarely go to the doctor to begin with so i'm not sure how to start this conversation. i don't want it to sound like i'm desperate begging for meds or something, i just need some relief. another reason i've avoided this is because i'm a little hesitant to go on meds, i know they can mess with a lot of people and i don't want to become totally dependent...another thing to worry about lol (thanks anxiety). i also know therapy is super helpful too, but it's honestly something i can't afford right now, my insurance doesn't cover much. i want to get into therapy in the next year if possible but it's not an option at the moment. so i'd appreciate anyone's insight on this and how i can go about talking about anxiety with my doctor. thanks.",reddit,1,1

12575,"social anxiety is ruining my life - i've always had problems talking to people and forming interpersonal relationships, but it's now at a point where it's safe to say that it is ruining my life. i only have two people that i somewhat regularly talk to, because they're friends from all the way back in elementary school. my family life is fucked, i live alone in a small apartment and talk to them only very occasionally. the only person from my family that i have a deeper connection with is my twin sister, who however has moved to the other side of the country, so i only see her very rarely. even she doesn't know of the full extent of my anxiety and depression, i think she just thinks that's just who i am. i just turned 21 now and i'm about to finish up an internship at an it company, that i luckily got not because of my social skills, but because i was top of my class and they offered it to me because of that. just like with every other job/school i've been to before though, i talk to no one unless it's absolutely necessary and i have to do it because of the job. i feel uncomfortable and don't feel like i can relate to anyone there, even though they're not bad people or anything. now my supervisor came up to me last friday and told me that while i do my job well, i won't be able to get a full time position after the internship (which was the mutual plan from the start) because of my lacking social skills and me not talking to anyone. this honestly didn't surprise me that much, but it still hit me like a brick. i was trying to hold back tears and felt completely dumbstruck for the rest of the day, not because i want the job so desperately, but because this is the nail in the coffin in my realization that my social anxiety is absolutely ruining my life. i am dealing with depression because of how miserable my life is and because of how terrible it feels to miss out on life. life is passing me by and i watch every year go by with minimal change. i've never even kissed a girl, i spend most of my time playing computer games or browsing the internet, because i have nothing else to do. the thought of engaging in social activity, let alone go to parties or something, ignites instant panic in me. the thing is that my supervisor offered to give me one last chance to better my social behavior in the remaining 1.5 months of my internship. he's surprisingly nice considering that most people usually write off my social anxiety as ignorance, and i don't hold a grudge against him for not wanting to employ me, i honestly probably wouldn't employ myself either. he recommended me to join an acting club because he believes that would help, but honestly that just made me panic and i can't even see myself doing something like this. i think i literally couldn't do it. he said i should think about it over the weekend. so what do i do? i can't see myself joining an acting club, the thought of that alone frightens me and i think i would only leave even more retreated in my shell. but if i say no that would show them that i'm not trying to better myself. the thought of seeing a therapist sounds more promising to me, there would be less pressure and i could try to figure myself out as to why i am like this. i definitely think it has to do with past experiences in my life, i developed trust issues from an abusive mother that might have developed into me not being able to get personal with anybody. then again i started questioning if it might be better if i don't even try to stay at that company after the internship. people there, while nice, already have the impression of me being a freak, and the longer i know people the harder it is to be myself around them after all this time. i might need a fresh start or just some time off for myself to really self reflect and get a handle on things. i just want to start living and stop this endless cycle of mundane existence. regardless, tomorrow i have to tell my supervisor what i have envisioned for the future, and i still don't know. any advice is appreciated, especially if you've been or are still going through the same things. thanks.",reddit,1,1

because i want that. now because of my friendless life and because i have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year im beyond scared to do school on campus so ive decided to do all of college online. ive definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. ive never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation im never going to meet one and if i do, i mentally ive already sabotaged myself because i think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that i have none. like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. so to avoid this im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. plus im insecure about my body bc im a little chubby but dont do anything to change this because i have zero motivation. so far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. i get depressed when i think about the fact that im so young and i have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. like am i really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. sometimes i think that the best i can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company i work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever. sorry for this long ass stupid rant. goodbye im sad as fuck now low key crying and depressed:))))",reddit,1,1

fantasy world i feel so bad and so much regret and this makes me want to escape life again. but this had also made me lose my concentration and i literally don't remember anything at all. i don't even know what i am saying, i forget things that i did in the past and where i placed stuff etc. if u can see how messy this post is it is literally how my brain works another problems is that i literally keep remembering the bad things that happened to me all the time when i am in the real world i believe that i have two faces my pretty face and my ugly face my pretty face is skinnier and with a smaller nose etc.. i feel when my face is the pretty one so i can look in the mirror and can be more productive and confident. but when i have my not pretty face i feel so down and i can't do anything, i can't go out in public, i sometimes cancel going out or feel so nervous and scared. i once was so nervous to go to a party that i started crying in the car. i am so sure about the pretty face thing because even my father noticed and he told me that my face looks different during not pretty face period and during my pretty face period after days later he told me that my face got smaller. i try to fake it and act normal when i am with others so no one knows that i suffer every single second of my life. especially that i go out during my pretty face times so i am more confident and they don't notice. i am determined to have a nose job, i even chose my surgeon. i feel like i will be happier after my nose job. i hate cameras so much, i don't like taking pictures and videos or look at old photos at all. i rarely take selfie and they are mostly through specific angles. i don't like opening cameras in online classes, and if i had cameras open i feel so nervous and my heart keeps beating for the whole class. i hate going out because of cameras. i feel so embarrassed by my daydreams but to be honest they make me happy. my fantasy world reached a point where i would lie about things that happened to me in real life but they actually haven't. i sometimes believe what happens in my dream world. i am literally addicted to my fantasy world i am even scared to show my face in public, especially after the masks thing nowadays i don't have this as much thankfully but last year for many many months i had sleep paralysis and nightmares almost every night. i can only look in the mirror if i pinched my nose every few seconds to make it look smaller. i have only seen my nose unpinched only 2 times maybe in the past years. i know it is terrible but i really don't like my natural nose. i also have to smile a certain way because i don't like the way my lips look when i have a straight face. looking in the mirror has so much rituals for me. i also don't like my feet and that is why i wear socks all day so that not me or anyone can see them. i also don't like real life because i feel so alone and scared, unlike in my fantasy world. i sometimes feel suicidal and have urges to cut, i brought a knife and placed it in my wrist multiple times but i thankfully didn't actually cut, i also feel like if i started cutting it will make marks in my skin and people would know aswell as ruin my skin and make me even more insecure about it. my fantasy world seems so real to the point that i once cried so bad when one of the people in my world died. i love my characters so much, because they actually help me, unlike in real life where i don't have anyone to tell. i am about 100lbs and people tell me that i am skinny but i rarely see myself as so. i know that i am skinny but i don't feel it. i don't believe i have an eating disorder because my whole diet consists of sodas and sugars and i don't really care as much. i don't like salads and vegetables and i rarely cook because it also puts me.in real life i keep getting these moments when i feel so nervous and scared for no reason and start to cry. i have no idea why i had tried to meditate and pray but i can't for many days because it makes me go into reality and it feels scary for me. i get intrusive thoughts about my looks all the time. like for example my brain tells me that i will never be pretty enough. and when i see models my brain tells me that i will never be like them. i am tearing up now and i honestly didn't tell anyone about this, i told my parents that i needed therapy but they won't let me go to because they don't think there is anything wrong with me. also both my parents are doctors and my mom would tell me (since i was young) that if i had any problems i should tell her. i do tell her about almost everything except this thing because it's embarrassing and she also has her own problems so i don't want to worry her. i dont want to self diagnose but i can't go to a psychiatric or psychologist, so does anyone know what should i do. i really want to become better but i am scared i don't care about my looks for other people but mostly to myself because i know that most people are not perfect and i honestly don't understand how they are ok about this, i feel like i should be perfect in every aspect, looks, education, clothing etc..",reddit,1,1

12671,"intense feeling of shame - hey guys, first time reddit user here. just some background information: i'm a 25 year old male and i've been struggling with social anxiety ever since i was a kid. i guess i want to vent about this day i had and this overwhelming sense of shame that i'm experiencing. i don't know where else to turn. &amp;#x200b; i've just completed 15 weeks of training as a train conductor, which usually involved shadowing another conductor during an average workday. today was my first day on my own. however, i got put on a job that wasn't covered a whole lot by our training (yard work). i wasn't comfortable with the job and i made this known to the two guys i was working with (i'll be referring to them as conductor and engineer). they were indifferent and uninterested in sitting down with me and helping me figure it out. so we set about our job, and it doesn't take too long before i make a mistake. conductor is immediately irritated. he starts giving me orders in a tone of voice that makes it very clear that he doesn't think much of me. naturally my anxiety starts to climb. i start second guessing everything that i do and making silly errors, causing more anger from the crew and more anxiety in me. by the end of the day, conductor is straight up yelling at me. engineer won't talk to me at all, but his face tells me everything i need to know about what he's thinking. i try to level with them, something that has helped me in the past. i apologize for my performance and ask for some patience as i learn this job. they don't give me an inch. engineer says something to the tune of, ""didn't they train you?"". conductor tells me that they could pull any guy off the street to the job i was doing. ""it's not rocket science"". at this point i feel like the biggest idiot on the planet. i want to crawl into a hole and pull it in after me, but we still have work to do. i make another mistake while we finish up with the same results, i clock out and walk to my car as fast as i can without standing out. it's been a few hours since i clocked out, and the whole time i have felt an intense feeling of shame. it won't leave me alone and its about all i can do to keep myself from breaking out into tears. i've tried to distract myself, i've tried to meditate, i've tried just letting myself feel the emotion. no matter what i do i can't let it go, it's like a stink that i can't seem to wash off. my mind keeps wandering back to the events of the day. the words said to me play again and again like a broken record. when i go to sleep, i'm willing to bet it's going to follow me into my dreams. i just want to put it past me, but the worst part is that i'll probably have to work with those guys again. the thought fills me with horrible dread. &amp;#x200b; have any of you had similar feelings and experiences? how do you deal with them? i could really use some advice, or maybe just encouragement. i'm trying my level best to drag my life out of the pit it was in, but i feel like i'm hitting a wall.",reddit,1,1

12716,"i am here for you if you need it, but first could you read this brain vomit first? - i try to be a good person. i will help people out whenever i can. i love being there for people and being able to make their day better. i have some inner turmoil over whether or not i am actually a good person or if i just delude myself into thinking i am. i get worried that i only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that i am one. i try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if i am only fooling myself? i have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. i am scared i am one of these people except everyone but me can see who i really am. i am basically friendless. i have one good friend who has an so and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that i meet to have drinks with. i am a mess about this. i try my best to be a good person, but if i were one, wouldn't i have people that cared about me like i do them? anyone i reach out to ignores me. i can't figure out why. am i obnoxious? am i so boring? do i really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? i like to learn things. i like discussion. i like to share nice things i think about people. i will admit when i am wrong. i try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. i have really bad anxiety. sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so i seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. but it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after i asked to hangout. i think, ""oh man, they want to hangout? no one wants to hang out with me. if they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. or, if it goes well i will just ruin the friendship another time."" i have gotten better at hiding it, i think, though. i think i am fun. i like who i am. i am always open to bettering myself. i wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. i have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. which is reasonable if i put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. i didn't care that i was vulnerable. i just want to fix myself. i have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. the small moments i have been, it is nice, but it is not something i seek at all. i just want people i meet/know to walk away thinking i was nice to talk to. that they had a good time sharing my company. it would be even nicer if i could have taught them something, or them pleased after i told them they taught me something. as much as i want those things, i cannot allow myself not to be me, though. i am very honest. i will not lie about anything, and the times i am forced to (socially, for some situation i cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. i have been called blunt, but i try to be tactful at all times. this leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. but i cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people i cared for. as i said, i will willingly admit that i am wrong. i think it is really important for people to admit that they are. you cannot know everything. not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. people i remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. for nearly a year i have been depressed about this. i broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because i felt i wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. i lost a group of friends when i started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. so, me being around made my ex sad (i am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and i went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. so i stopped getting invites to things.. then i stopped getting responses when i would try to plan something. this made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. for a couple months after that i tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. at this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. i started to feel bad that i couldn't be the person she fell for. i was too depressed to be me. and the days i felt like myself i still would get pangs of chest pain because i knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (she convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. which, it was, but not all like she thought. this was also good advice from her point of view because i had a lot in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. so leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) i was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me i stop loving her. she deserved someone better, so i made that choice for her. i wanted to be better. i wanted to be someone she deserved. so i started trying to be a person. i went and got a real hairstyle (i use to just use clippers and do it myself.) i started running/biking again. (i have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) i got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. i went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and i just wore running/work out attire. i enrolled in school, which is something i stopped when i went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. in school i started strong, i was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so i could get connections for an internship. then my anxiety hit me, hard. i couldn't finish my resume because i am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. i lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. that caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. my 4 a's fell to near f's and i was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate i knew from an old job and rounded my grades to c's before the end. even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. nothing changed. no one cared. i ended things last november with her. i was motivated to better myself until april. i went to the gym every other day, i ate healthy, i wasn't excited to be back in school, but i did it and took pride in doing so. but the pride in myself diminished to nothing. i still had no one to go have fun with. no one texted how i was doing. i even stopped getting likes/conversations on tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. i am lonelier more than ever, and i have been without close people most of my life. i use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. or teach people english (which is something that brought me joy.) now the only connection i feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes i get on something. i use to be a lurker and only send messages when i saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. i would just tell them i would be here to listen for the former case and that i appreciate them if it were the latter. i use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. it is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. since april i have basically laid in bed. i still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. i browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. i don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy i am. i don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if i am really fooling people. i don't want to be a burden so i don't talk about anything. when my brother's girlfriend asked why i wasn't leaving for classes i told her i missed the deadline to enroll because i was depressed a friend of mine passed away. really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. i would have loved to be friends with her. she was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. i was especially torn up about losing someone that i use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. she was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, i wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. why couldn't the world have taken me instead? i can't find any strength in myself. i don't know what to do.",reddit,1,1

12731,"i'm not able to talk with some family members. - hello. i'm 17f. i'm not sure if i want to post it but i need to vent something (and i have experience that when i something post on net i'm really scared of reaction. once i post one story i wrote. i thought it was good but then i started feel anxious. this feeling grew up and i started think about how stupid and bad it was so i deleted it) now the real reason i decided to write there. my aunt is going to have a birthday party tomorrow. she invited whole family and some people who she knows. it's sounds like fun but not for me. but her friends (for me strangers) aren't my biggest problem. i will just ignore them and i hope they will ignore me too. my problem is that i'm not able to talk with most of my own family. always when we visited aunt and uncle i was in my cousins' room and usually stay there for hours (also it was when grandma lives so when i wasn't with cousins i was with here.. *they lived in one big house*) but then granda died and one of cousins got married and the second moved so i had to be with aunt, uncle, mother and her bf (basically my stepfather but i stopped talk with him too.. i don't know when. i don't know how. i don't know why. it has just happened). now when we visit aunt and uncle (i always try to avoid it) i usually sit in another room and watch tv or do something on phone while everybody talk in other room. i don't want to join into their conversation because their usually talk about people i don't know or about think i don't care about. sometimes they start smalltalk with me because they want to ask about school or boyfriend(i don't have bf and tbh i don't want anybody. and everybody ask me about relationship and when i'll find someone. it's annoying. when we visit relatives and i'm bored and text with friends they automatically ask on boyfriend. even if i say i don't have bf and it's only friend they ignore that answer. i really hate this.) with my brother i have similar problem with communication. eight/seven years ago he had to moved (because of our mother's boyfriend) so he lived with father. at first i was happy because of sibling's fights but then i just didn't care. he didn't live far away from me and mother but even so we didn't talk very much (greeting when we met and sometimes short conversation what he started. only per year). when he graduated he was standing in front of our house and was talking with mother about it. when i arrived from school they told me this news. i didn't know what to say (i didn't care tbh) so i only said 'congrats' and went to my room. last year he found gf and few months ago they moved because of work (circa 6-7 hours traveling by car from there). once i visited him (to be honest, i was scared what he thinks about me 'cause i twice refused visiting him and my mother wanted me to go too). our whole conversation was a few sentences. we were alone in house and if he didn't start asking me about school there would be silence. and... when we were talking i was nervous. i wasn't able to talk with him without fast heartbeat. as if i was talking with some stranger. and maybe he is stranger. i realised that i know nothing about him. the rest of this visit i was quiet. i listened them six hours with few sentences i replied when someone asked me on something. but i didn't feel bored(like when i have to visit aunt). i just felt ok when i could listen them and i always was nervous when they were quiet(i was scared that they start asking me). but i would like to talk with them like normal people again (at least with my brother 'cause aunt said me few things that force me to feel hatred toward her. toward her and others family members.. and because of my anxiety. i don't think they know about it because i avoid meeting them. but they did some nice things too.) i don't know how to start a conversation with them. i don't know what should i say. i know nothing about them. to be honest brother and his gf arrived two days ago and now they are at father's house. i come there almost every day so i was there when they arrived. but i didn't say welcome or something else. i was in my room and i hoped that they don't come there. and yesterday too. when i came there i sneaked to my room and i was happy because i didn't meet them on hallway. (they saw my shoes in front of my door but they didn't knock on door. i don't know what they think about me, what makes me feel little anxious, but they don't have a need to start conversation with me, neither). even if i would be probably glad for tips how to fix this, i'm not sure if i would be able to realise it. i can say to myself 'do this, do that' but do it is sometimes really hard and i just give up and let anxiety win. thanks for read this and sorry for my imperfect english. i'm curious if tomorrow i will be able to say them something more than hi/hello.",reddit,1,1

12782,"i feel like everyday of my life is a sex and the city episode, and that im carrie bradshaw learning a new lesson - for many people the scariest thing about driving are incompetent drivers. but today i found out, the scariest thing about driving for me, is being seen as an incompetent driver. as none of you may now, i'm a very new, very inexperienced driver, who still only his permit. i just got my mom to stop hollering at me every second while driving, and to trust my very shotty judgement when it comes to some things on the road. but today, i felt like all my efforts were dashed. i had just (fairly safely) driven my mom to her favorite food chain, panda express. and as i was waiting there in the drivers seat of the car, i decided to pull out my tablet from the backseat and play king of king of fighters, and advanced guardian heroes. this action made me feel like i was very childish, and that everybody was wondering why i, a grown man of 18, was sitting there in the drivers seat. i let this emotion simmer in me for a while, until it was time for us to leave. so as i was pulling out of the parking lot, an asian lady and her husband were trying to get into their car, that happened to be parked right next to me. i tried to stop backing up, and ask if she wanted to get into the car first, but this just led to a very confused stare. so then i decided to proceed to back out, a little rattled and embarrassed, but going on strong. as i was backing out, my mom started yelling at me that i was too close to their car (which i don't think i was) and this kinda stayed the vibe for the rest of the car ride when i got back home, i was despondent. i decided to eat some food, and watch some king of the hill. in this particular episode of king of the hill, its showed peggy wanting so badly to be seen as a cool person. that she decide to change everything about her that made her her. this made me think that peggy had devalued herself and her abilities as a person. the end of the episode ended with her being friends with the cool mom, because the cool mom was just putting on an act too i realized that i was scared that other people saw me as a bad driver, and it made me understand that i devalued my self and abilities as a driver. i didn't take into account that i have literally improved so much from the time i first started to learn how to drive. i exercised a little, read some online articles about the pitfalls of devaluing yourself as a person, and listened to my favorite playlist, and suddenly, i didn't feel so bad about the miniscule situation that happened in the parking lot of a panda express. lesson of the day : don't devalue yourself. we're all equal as human beings. and youre emotions and feelings aren't any less than anyone elses. its okay to not ve perfect. think about the way you let people treat you, and if you, as a decent person, would treat anyone else like that. youre enough because you're enough. and that's enough.",reddit,1,1
12783,"i feel like my personality sucks. - first post, sorry for my english. i just need to get this out if my chest. maybe this is going to be long, you're warned ! i'm a college student (f21), and as far as i remember i've always been the shy type of person, introverted and anxious as hell when i had to speak in front of people. one of my biggest fear was, and still is to end up alone. four months ago, i got my degree, and after a lot of work, was accepted in a really great school for my master. i should have been excited and happy, but all i could think about was the fear of not fitting in my new class, not getting along with the other students (we're 21). this college is far away from my town, so i left my family and bf, which was very hard since they're my pillars in life. i told myself i just needed to be myself, and it was ok if i didn't make any friends, but then college started, and as i expected, i felt terrible in this new environement. i managed to speak to few people on the first day, but quickly the shyness took over me, and while they were all starting to be friends and laughing together, i ended up being the quiet loner. i'm feeling incredibly frustrated and sad, because i pushed myself so much to be social, but there was no results. it just doesn't seem to work, and i'm starting to think my personality really sucks. i know it's not easy to communicate with me, and i get that i'm not really a fun person, but even when i try to be, nothing works. i get up everyday feeling sick and not wanting to go to college because i know i'll be alone. i know it's just a bad moment to go through, but i'm tired of being the weirdo, tired of having to do so much efforts everyday with no results, tired to see people judging me and thinking i have a problem. ( i do have old scarification/self harm scars all over my arm and shoulder, and it seems to scare people. i can understand.) tomorrow, we're all going to a three days integration trip. the idea of spending three days with ""strangers"" is terrifying. they all planned to do different things together, and i'm just there, with nothing to do, and no one to speak to. in short, i have no idea what to do to not feel so lonely anymore. i feel dumb for wanting to socialise so much, when my first goal is to get my master. i'm lost, and i'm starting to hate my personality because no one seems to like it.",reddit,1,1
12784,"does this qualify as social anxiety or am i just a bit shy/something else? - hi all, i'm a 25-year old male from the uk, and i was also diagnosed with asperger's when i was 4. something i've noticed over the last year or so is that i am not at all shy when it comes to talking to people, and occasionally i can go out of my way to and meet and speak to people i've never met before (such as a speed-dating event) and once thrown together with random people i can actually speak to them quite well. however, the main problem i have is being very averse to putting my foot in the door and agreeing to take part in things that involve meeting new people, and i also have very few contacts outside of my school friends, my work colleagues and my friends from uni. it's not that i feel actively scared of meeting new people, but it might be more of a subconscious thing. as a result, i hardly ever go out unless it's for a purpose or within my comfort zone. i do start worrying about what might happen or what they might think of me. i would describe myself as an introvert who masquerades as an extrovert. does this quality as any sort of social anxiety or is it just another characteristic? tl;dr - i can talk to random people when thrown together in a confident way, but i am very averse to actually going out and meeting people i have never met before.",reddit,1,1

12920,"social anxiety and depression making me want to end it once again but i cant because of my family. - i lost my best friend to suicide two years ago. ive experienced and seen the aftermath. i love my family, and no matter how horrible and empty i feel i vowed never to do that to them. in fact i dont even let my pain show. the crying for hours, binge drinking (aka right now), the cutting. i especially would never put my little brother through that. the last time i let it show was age 14 when i accidentally cut too deep after a traumatic experience and needed to go to the hospital. my mom picked me up and my family never talked about it again. im almost 20 now. its never gotten better it seems. and lately im getting so tired. its getting more and more difficult each day. i dont have any friends because of my anxiety, yet ive allowed myself to date a string of awful boys for the past few years. i dont fit into cliques of girls and most guys just try to hook up or date (it seems) i live in an extremely hick, small town. i use to read and write and i use to model but i dont do anything anymore. recently i deleted all of my social media, and i got rid of most of my belongings. i cant afford therapy, but somehow i got this well paying job without stellar experience. i start in two weeks. right before the interview i cried in the bathroom because of my anxiety. i think they only hired me because they felt bad or because of the holidays are coming up. i need this job in order to receive mental health help but my anxiety symptoms are so hard to control. i cant even drive anymore because of dissociation. i truly believe ill get fired the first day because of how bad the interview went. doing the same thing everyday and drinking alone at night is killing me. i try to go out alone but i live in a dangerous area. the last time i went out involved the cops arresting three boys for harassing me. at a library. im taking online classes but ive been abusing them. i dumped my ex of a year about a week ago. i have no friends whatsoever. im a pathetic and lonely person. i want to cry out for help but my family has so many issues already there really is no space for me. im trying to suck it up but im hurting so bad it feels unbearable most nights. awful crying spells and bouts of paranoia. im sorry if this doesnt make any sense. im just drunk and sad again.",reddit,1,1

12964,"everything is great until it suddenly isnt. i need help/advice please. - hey. i have been suffering social anxiety most of my life. i was an ugly overweight child. i was really good in school, mostly as, but i was bullied. a lot. and it really affected my self confidence. i found it hard to make friends, and even harder to keep them. i was 15/16 when i finally started to make some friends. i came out as gay and things became a little easier and i found some friends that i was happy with. im now 24 and living in a big city that i love. i live near 2 very good friends, have a good apartment i love, a really nice housemate/landlord and although my job isnt paying well atm (my hours are low atm but are going up in the next few weeks) i really do enjoy it. i have a great boss and i literally feel that we can talk about anything, and i have come to become friends and i admire/look up to him quite a lot. and i also have become friends and quite look up to his husband as well. what i am going through now happened before in college and its really worrying me. in my last year i felt i had literally run out of conversations with my friends and we drifted apart. i found it hard to keep up any conversation or think of what to say. i could almost hear them being sick of me. me and those friends barely talk anymore, and i finished college 2 years ago. i go through periods of being able to be a good conversationalist and these can last months and i form good friendships. unfortunately, this can change very suddenly and im back to what i was like in college. these usually last a week or so. and it started again last week. but this time feels different, i dont know why. i went to my friends house last week and we didnt speak much. i dogsat for them last night and left shortly after i came home. my housemate isnt being very talkative with me lately either. the only person i have no trouble conversing with is my boss but i dont want to burden him with this. his business is new and i am doing whatever i can to help him and i dont want to distract him with my problems. he is the most genuinely nice and honest man i have ever met, and we get on so well. i just feel like my life is completely pointless and aimless. that i have had great luck (great apartment, great job, met the best people possible) and im just wasting it. i dont want to lose what i have but i dont know how to keep it. i feel i need to be happier and things will be better, but i dont really know what in life makes me happy anymore. has anyone ever been in a similar situation and what did you do to get out of it?",reddit,1,1
12965,"why am i so socially anxious despite not being anxious in general and having no reason to be socially anxious? - i have really bad social anxiety, to the point of selective mutism ever since i entered preschool. thanks to this, i never made any friends growing up except my brother and now i'm 21 without ever having had any kind of friend. so i spend nearly all day at home everyday, except when i go for a walk. it also goes without saying that i've never done anything even remotely romantic with a girl. but the weird thing is that i have good parents and they was never bullied even once growing up and during elementary, middle, and high school. i just get anxious to the point of not saying anything whenever i'm out of my comfort zone. this has always puzzled me. i'm rarely anxious otherwise, and i've even nearly died a few times (because of my own stupidity lol) but none of that made me feel very anxious at all, unlike the prospect of socializing. is this all genetic? my parents and brother are normal as hell, though. i took a big 5 personality test, and as expected, i scored low on generalized anxiety (8th percentile) but extremely high on self-consciousness/social anxiety (98th percentile). but why?",reddit,1,1

12984,"i was always shy as a kid, got bullied and was too afraid to say anything so it continued, then i developed low self esteem and learned to keep my feelings inside, which i still do today. i also had a lot of negative experiences, so rather than making a fool of myself or not wanting to look stupid or feel humiliated (because it happened before), this led to avoiding, which (of course) makes things worse. my parents didn't originally know how to ""parent,"" children's aid used to come to our home. but after that, my parents became overly protective. i only learned how to tie my shoes a few years ago (i am 16..) and by myself, and i don't have to do anything in my life because my mother does all of it, which i already know will impact me in future (encourages my avoidance and not knowing how to be independent). i bring up the topic of social anxiety sometimes, and they get the idea that i am asocial (as an extreme introvert) but won't accept that i am socially anxious. they say i am over exaggerating, others have it worse, we all experience anxiety, things like that.. so even as a kid, i never had anyone to go to about my feelings or problems. i don't allow myself to cry at home because they'd say i have no reason to, and i don't want my siblings seeing how ""weak"" i am, especially since i get random urges to cry and often not able to explain why. since i was 7 years old i've used the computer for gaming for hours everyday, which may have impacted me socially?",reddit,1,1

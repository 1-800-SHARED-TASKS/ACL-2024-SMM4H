8809,"i got diagnosed 10 yrs ago as a teen, have been through nearly everything. i second diet and supplement treatment, as i tried plaquenil and had more negatives than positive. i've come to terms that my sjogren's isn't going away, but if i can prolong the best of my health then i will. with plaquenil, i was cranky/snippy all the time, more sensitive to sunlight (became practically a hermit), and severe tummy issues. i had less joint pain, but that was about it. i've found the right supplement mix with the help of a naturopath, and sticking to a balanced diet has allowed for long-term steady health. i found the mediterranean diet was best for me (though i skip the wine part); i stay away from inflammatory foods like red meat, rather sticking to anti-inflammatory stuff like garlic, turmeric, etc. i really like fish for the omega-3s. and i drink a shitton of water too. obviously, i'm not a doctor, so check in with a doctor first if you can. also, i do have a pre-hypothyroidism situation going on, and it seems that the neck lumps is a concern of yours based on other comments. i take a supplement to pull back on that and get my thyroid back to normal, and that has helped my jawline come back a bit. i'd advise asking a doctor to check on other autoimmune or thyroid issues as well, as where there's one autoimmune issue, there's more stuff going on. lastly, i know that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but acupuncture has helped me the most with gland reduction and proper salivation, to a point my dentist pointed it out at my regular checkup after starting acu treatments. my chronic pain has also definitely gone way down. i'm very lucky in that my insurance covers it, and it's definitely not for everyone, just my experience. everybody's bodies are different, and a lot of folks with autoimmune issues tend to have a fun lil cocktail of stuff going on. find a doctor you trust who's willing to figure out your situation and determine the best fit for your needs. if you're interested in more natural remedies, i recommend a naturopath. if you prefer western medicine and get more benefits from plaquenil, a primary care doc and *especially* a rheumatologist are your best bet.",reddit,0,0
8811,"your need for glasses is determined by your genetic heritage and epigenetic stressors in your environment. meaning, that what physical traits you inherit can influence how your eye develops. also, how much time you spend outdoors, how long you read, and how close you hold the material to your eyes can all have an influence on the development of your vision. even such things as allergies, and eye rubbing could cause deterioration in vision over time (keratoconus is one example). these are just some of the epigenetic factors that can influence vision development. most eye doctors don't prescribe glasses to people who don't need them. unfortunately, there's always a few bad apples in every profession; if you're the victim of one, you have my sympathies. in spite of that, i doubt your glasses had anything to do with you developing worsening vision over the last 10 years. in other words, correlation does not imply causation, it's a common logical fallacy. the good news, wearing glasses have not damaged your eyes.",reddit,0,0

8852,"i've had a consistent prescription for about 20 years and have excellent vision (corrected). my previous glasses have started to fall apart, so i went to a highly recommended optometrist (i.e. not a discount shop or a costco/walmart) to get new glasses. my exam showed that my previous prescription is fine. my prescription is -3.75, -3.50 spherical (no cylinders, no progressives, etc). upon receiving my new glasses, i noted a vertical line of distortion approx 5-10<u+00b0> off my visual center, away from the center of my face in both lenses - the right being more noticeable. this vertical line causes images to blur, but as i turn past it the image returns to the same level of sharpness as my visual center. eventually, the image blurs as expected heading toward the edge of the lens. my guess would be that the index of refraction is slightly different here - a degree or two wide. when marking this effect on my lens, it is about 1 cm out from my optical center (i.e. not an edge distortion). the effect is less noticeable up close (like reading a book), but very noticeable driving or looking at fine detail beyond about 10 ft or so (e.g. tv screen across room, map on wall). additionally, my right eye is slightly blurry, mostly in distance vision (beyond the \~10 ft range). when looking anywhere but up close, its causes my vision to be distracting - like i need to rub my eye and clear it up. as expected, when using only my right eye the blurriness is much more noticeable than when combined, but still aggravating when using both eyes. oddly, i inadvertently noticed while rubbing my eye, that when my glasses slide up so the nose piece rested on top of my nose, my vision becomes sharp in both eyes. marking on the lens, this is about 2 cm out and 2 cm down from optical center. i don't know if that matters, but i figured i'd mention it as my my vision is great in that position, but it obviously looks ridiculous. i've returned to the opticians multiple times. they remanufactured the lenses thinking there was some sort of defect multiple times. i did note a slight improvement on the left side, but its really hard to compare as each remake has been about a month apart. i'd had to argue with them a bit to explain that i wasn't talking about edge distortion and get them to actually listen to what i described. i've also been told it is because my lenses are wider, so i am looking through more material when i look off axis. i find that unlikely at 5-10<u+00b0> off axis, plus it clears up after a narrow distortion. the next to last time i went in, they asked me to go more than a couple days and try a full two weeks as my eyes needed more time to adjust (i've never taken more than a day or so to adjust in the past, but i'm getting older, so maybe). they have checked the as-made prescription, my old glasses (prescription matches), and reverified my measurements against the as-built. on my final visit (after a full two weeks of dealing with this annoying blurriness), i went in to the doctor instead of the optician. she verified my prescription and suggested that maybe the coating is causing an issue or a material change could be causing the difference. i brought my old glasses back in and they saw that they were polycarbonate (my new lenses are trivex). the optician told me that i just need to wait longer to adjust. i'm at 2.5 weeks of wearing them all the time. i feel like the office has just written me off - they already lost money on remaking the lenses a couple times. i don't know what to do. if it was just the vertical distortion, i could probably learn to try and ignore it. i feel like my options are: 1) accept them as is and hope more weeks of waiting pay off 2) return them and go back to old glasses until the fully disintegrate 3) take current glasses to another optometrist and see if they have a better solution/idea of what is happening 4) return the glasses, go somewhere else, hope that i don't have the same issue i've been wearing glasses for some 30 years now and the only thing i've had like this was a prescription made wrong in one eye which was quickly corrected and worked great. thanks in advance for your responses.",reddit,0,0

[this image]( illustrates what i mean quite well. by suggesting a smaller diameter frame (which the second one is), you basically guarantee that the lenses will be cut out into a smaller shape, meaning thinner at the edges. so yes, the second frame is a much better choice for you. to sum up, there isn't a lot you can do besides going for an even smaller frame, which i undestand if you don't want to do, or going for 1.74, which is quite a lot more expensive than a 1.67. another option is to look at some frames sold elsewhere, perhaps online. you might find some acetate frames with nosepads that might suit you, and specsavers (at least here in the uk) offer a service where you bring in your own frame for them to put new lenses in. hope that helps!",reddit,0,0

[example of what i see at night]( for me, it's not about confidence or learning how to get around it, it's the inability to see well, period, and finding ways to work around is challenging. my life has been driven by my keratoconus (i just had to accept that), and i have to make choices that accommodate my vision as best as i can. when i was younger, people would pressure me into things, like driving, and they didn't understand my eye disease, they were trying to help, i'm sure, but they couldn't grasp the fact that it's just that my vision is poor and no ""learning"" to drive at night isn't going to help any... i'll emphasize this, if she cannot see well at night, don't even force her, it's safer for her and anyone else on the road. i hope you don't feel like i'm attacking... but this is a subjective i feel really passionate about as i lived with it for so long. it's a hard pill to swallow, but it's like telling someone in a wheelchair that they just need to learn how to stand up more--i know, bad example, but sometimes that's how i feel with people pressuring me about my eyes. so if she doesn't feel comfortable with her vision, then it might be best to find alternatives, maybe her job could provide reasonable accommodations in order for her to do her job fully. best of luck to her, and yourself. life doesn't stop with keratoconus, it just gets more interesting as we have to find different life paths to take, ones that no one else can see.",reddit,0,0

8914,"it's possible you were having issues getting the best prescription because your eyes have been dry. dryness will alter the surface of your eye. this can cause fluctuating astigmatism values or inaccurate measurements from the machines or whoever is doing the refraction (optometrist most likely). regardless of what you choose to do, is recommend treating the dry eye aggressively to see if this helps your overall situation. use an artificial tear 4 times a day in both eyes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). use the drop even if you don't feel you need it. if you use the tears more than 4-6 times a day, switch to a preservative free variety. also, don't use anything with a redness reducer. so avoid visine, clear eyes, ophcon, naphcon, and lumify. i'd suggest a brand like refresh, blink, systane, liquitears, genteal, or theratears. there are a bunch of brands but you can use any, even the cheapest is a good place to start. in addition, do a hot compress once a day for 5 minutes (heat a washcloth under hot water and rest it on the closed eyes). once the 5 minutes are over, take the heat off the eyelids and gently massage the eyelids with your fingers. this will also help improve the quality of your tears. furthermore, if you work on screens often or read a lot or do focused near work (knitting, puzzles, crosswords, painting...), this is contributing to your dry eye surface. follow what's called the 20/20/20 rule. every 20 minutes is focused work/tv/computer..., take a 20 second break where you look up from what you're doing and look 2 feet away. it will help remind you to blink and reduce strain. you should also put an extra eye drop in before doing your focused activity to help keep the surface lubricated. another important thing to know is your age. if you're under 16, your glasses are much more important for the health of your eyes and you need the most accurate prescription. if you're older than that, wearing any glasses won't hurt your eyes. but if you're wearing the wrong prescription, things will be blurry and you're more likely to get eye strain and headaches while using the glasses. just because you are given a prescription for glasses doesn't mean you have to get it. if you're concerned the prescription isn't great, get another opinion and a new refraction (preferably after treating your dry eyes for at least 2-4 weeks). you'll be glad it only cost you a glasses exam fee instead of having to buy two pairs of glasses (which can get quite costly).",reddit,0,0

9061,"my point is, and has always been, there won't be a significant/overwhelming difference to the patients vision. and my point is i think there will be for most people. i guess we will agree to disagree. i am basing my assessment of this rx by solely relying on my experience dispending glasses and what people do and do not complain about and what people do and do not exclaim improvement about. obviously this is highly subjective on my part, and the part of my patients. of course there are those patients that seemly don't care at all about prescription changes, and yet others that claim they can differentiate .01d and <u+00bc> axis changes. there are 55 year people with +2.00 -1.25 x 090 with +2.25add that will tell you they see perfectly fine everywhere without glasses. but in my experience the majority of people would notice improvement between these two prescriptions(still just talking right eye obviously) if they are shown the difference between the two. i would say that there would be fewer people with complaints if they didn't have the reference of the other rx to compare it to. in other words, if someone's ""correct"" rx is -50 -75 x 090 and they are given -75 -.25 x 125, there would be less objections than if they were given the opportunity to trial frames both rx. because they have no reference that it could be better. what is significant in a clinical description is different than what is subjectively significant in a dispensing setting.",reddit,0,0

9090,"i can relate... i've been waering rgp lenses for about 10 years now. the fitting was a real pain in the butt especially on my right eye on which the keratoconus is very advanced in the last stage and on which i have a large scar on my cornea which prevented my lense from ever fitting correctly on that eye. since my contacts have always been kinda uncomfortable i was using a lot of preservative free solutions and drops the meant to imitate tears. i used ""hylo comod"" which can be used while wearing your4 contacts. in addition my eyes got very sticky and my vision got very blurry over long day with warm and dry air around me for which i couldn't find anything for a long time. for a almost a year now tho, i have a daily eye cleaning routine in the morning where i clean my eye lids. there are certain pores on the brink of the eye lid that give off an oily solution that is part of your natural tears. my pores are clogged tho from time to time which makes it diffucult. i'm using ""lipo nit"" for this. regarding scleral lenses. i'm currently switching to full scleral lenses at the moment because wearing the corneal lense became to painful on my right eye. i got the first scleral lense on nmy right eye in march and i'm absolutely in love with them. it took two tries to make it right but the final feeling was jsut great. or should i say there was no feeling at all since i couldn't tell if i was wearing any lenses at all. noe i could even roll my eyes without having my lenses disappear somewhere behind my eye lids... i also haven't had any issues with my scleral lense and my environment. not with dust. not with wind. not with rain. the only problem that i have is that i sometimes have to change the solution at some point of the day because my vison gets a bit blurry. mostly i have to do that 1 or 2 hours after i put them in first. i use little saline vials without any preservatives to fill my contact lense. i would also suggest that you keep trying to find a better fitting lense. if you keep struggeling with your mini scleral lenses you could think about upgrading to the really big ones. they look a bit intimidating but they feel great and nowadays, they are really safe to use and you don't have to fear that your eye suffers from lack of oxygen. i hope things work out for you!",reddit,0,0

9139,"thanks, i am glad you find them informative. side effects: 1. when i take them out at night (16 hours of wear), they leave a temporary indentation on my sclera (white part of eye). this usually goes back to its normal position within an hour. i told my doctor about this and they said it is normal and does not negatively impact the health of the eye. 2. this also happens when i remove the lenses, my eyes get extremely bloodshot for at least 30 minutes. this is a reaction as the lens is pulled off of the sclera. blood rushes to the area as the tissue rebounds to the normal position. again, this is normal and not harmful, according to my doctor. precautions: 1. i don't wear them in the shower and i never take a nap in them under any circumstances. hypoxia risk is always present, as with any contact lens. my sclerals are made of an extremely oxygen permeable material that allows more oxygen to pass through than most soft contact lenses. i don't take them out for 18 hours after i put them in. i was told by my doctor that this is fine, but if my eyes started to feel irritated, remove the lenses. it's never been an issue. the first week i had the sclerals, i did have bubbles under the lenses after installation a couple times. this required immediate removal and reinstall. but now that it's been 6 months, i never have the issue. i can have both installed in about 1 minute (30 seconds per eye). it sounds like your eye doc isn't well trained in sclerals and fitting (no offense). my doc had the proper fit and lens shape within 5 minutes. also taught me to install them in another 5 minutes. your doc is correct in that if bubbles start forming at the edge of the lens, something is wrong with the fit and would need to be removed immediately. you want a good seal to keep the tear exchange minimal. also means the lens is properly resting on your eye for optimal visual clarity. there are gp lenses that are more oxygen permeable than soft lenses. these are the lenses i wear (with the hydrapeg coating): 6 months ago, before my sclerals, i was also in that deep dry-eye induced depression. i was using hundreds of dollars of otc lubricating eye drops and several hundred dollars per month on prescription eye medications (steroids, xiidra). i was so pissed. i paid 8k cash for the best, newest version of lasik available. and it almost ruined my life. i tried everything and nothing kept my eyes moist enough to not feel dry. it severely impacted my visual acuity. i couldn't drive in low light and in the daytime i had severe halos and glare on just about object. fast forward to today, i have sclerals. but i can see better than ever before in my life. it feels like i can see forever. night vision is fine. my eyes never feel dry. i don't spend hundreds of dollars on eye drops every month. life is better. definitely look into sclerals again. let me know if you have any questions!",reddit,0,0

9151,"so it's ok if the lenses come in different from what was prescribed because i order them differently. you can't just willy nilly ordered them differently. if the rx is adjusted for frame fit values then yes. opticians have been doing this for decades. it has been lost due to the uneducation of the profession. now it is back into the mainstream with freeform lenses. if a patient is a -12.00 refracted at 13.75mm but the frame they are getting sits as 10mm you can't just order a -12.00, they will be a half diopter over minused. the rx needs to be ordered as a -11.50 so the patient gets the correct power when wearing the glasses. adjusting the rest of the rx for tilt and wrap is just a very much more complicated version of this. ansi z80.1-2020 states: . both uncut and edged finished lenses shall meet the following requirements. for lenses produced with ""as-worn""<u+009d> compensations, the tolerances in clause 5 **apply to those values specified by the supplier of the spectacle component or completed spectacles and not to the prescribed power.** -emphasis is mine. yes, axis will change depending of frame fit. axis can change dramatically in the case of sport frames with high tilt and wrap. as i said there is no way for you to know if the axis is off by what op posted. the ordered axes are 15 and 114. you would need to read the lenses in the lensmeter and compare them to these numbers then apply the ansi tolerance guidelines.",reddit,0,0

9153,"the power of your focus is determined by the curvature of your lens and cornea. astigmatism is when one or both structures (usually the cornea) curves in one direction more than the other (like an egg or football). therefore, glasses correction must account for different directions instead of assuming all sides curve equally. there is nothing that can be done to prevent astigmatism changes. it's a result of the shape of physical structures in the eyes. it typically stays the same, or very similar, through out life. the exception being towards your 50s or 60s when cataract development causes some changes (which is something else you can't avoid).",reddit,0,0

[this one]( has a summary in english, came out last year and was done at my home university on a 100 patients over 10 years. it's now been 5 years since my cxl on my left eye, and that eye has been completely stable since then, no change in vision. my kc is not to progressed, so i still use glasses, however i have been told that contact lenses can correct the problems with kc very well, so i think you shouldn't worry too much about her not being able to see well enough to care for you kid. concerning the procedure itself: i was really nervous, but it wasn't actually that bad. your eyes are numbed, so you don't really feel a thing, although seeing how the surgeon scrapes off your epithel and having to stare into a uv lamp feels a bit weird. regarding the aftercare: i was in quite a bit of pain and very light-sensitive for about 3 days, so i took some regular painkillers (ibuprofen) and mostly just laid in my room with the blinds drawn. my parents helped me with putting the prescribed drops in my eyes. after that i was basically functional again, although still quite light-sensitive and with bad vision on my left eye. i wore an eyepatch for about a week, sunglasses afterwards. after a month my vision was almost completely recovered. a week of time-off, maybe two would make sense.",reddit,0,0

9246,"dear fellow redditors, i have just been to two different optomologist who gave me two quite different measurements: \------- the first one: right eye: -0.25,-1,50, 5 left eye: -0,5, -3.0, 165 \------- the second one: right eye: -0.25,-1,50, 5 left eye: -0.25, -2.0, 165 \------- the second doctor was fully aware of the measurements by the first one. he still set the cylinder to -2.0 as this is my current prescription, and he said it's not worth the trouble to adjust to a different cylinder and that i would never notice the change in real life even if i got used to a higher cylinder. now i know that my left eye has gotten worse from my current prescription. for example, if i cover my left eye while writing this post i can read it all normally, but if i cover my right eye it's all a blur and i might be able to read a few sentences with a lot of straining and some guesses. the solution here is obvious: i'll go to a third optomologist and just look at my left eye for cylinders in the range of -2.0 to -3.0 and then decide. my condition is that i can read reddit post with my phone 15-20cm away haha. the other question i have is about lenses. after a bunch of research online, i've pretty much settled on hoya. the safest option is nulux identity v+, either 1.6 or 1.67 cut (i don't really see the need for the 1.67). now my only worry is that i'm a computational physicist which means i spend around 9 hours a day behind a computer. so the hoya sync seems quite attractive. the only problem is that i don't know how the lens will react, as i use a pc most of the time, with the screen around 40cm from my face and completely leveled with my hight (i look at it directly through the center of the lens) unless i move my eyes to the corners of the screen, but then i have no idea how the lens will react. when i'm not using the pc i use my laptop holding it in my lap, so i'm definitely looking down (around the 30-40cm) from my eyes, or i use my phone again definitely looking down around 10-15cm from my eye. now i really don't know what to do here. if i go with the v+ nothing can go wrong... but if i pick the sync lenses, my eyes can get massive relaxation, or my vision gets really screwed. any comment/opinion appreciated (even different lens recommendations) thank you all for your time. sincerely, kevin.",reddit,0,0

9262,"most likely thing you have is dry eyes. focused activity line computer work, tv, driving, reading... all contribute to dry eye because your brain forgets to blink. this allows the surface of the eye to dry out and become irregular. this is what causes the blurry vision. i'd recommend a few things. first, use artificial tears on a regular basis 4 times per day, even if you don't think you need it. this will help keep the surface regular. second is to use the 20-20-20 rule. every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break by looking 20 feet away. this helps break up your tasks and reminds you to blink. the recent quarantine with increased computer time (and decreased sleep) have likely made it worse. as far as amblyopia (sounds like this is what you're describing as your right eye not seeing as well as your left), there is likely little more that can be done to improve the blurry vision. amblyopia is a poor communication between the eye and the brain. the eyes have to learn how to talk to the brain when you're a child. there are many things that can cause poor communication between the eye and the brain (i.e. different glasses prescription between the eyes, one eye having more astigmatism than the other, cataract in one eye, eyelid drooping in one eye...). if this isn't corrected, the brain and eye lose the ability to learn how to communicate and that blur becomes permanent. kids who wear patches are being treated for amblyopia by covering their good eye and forcing their bad eye to learn that communication. after the age of about 12-16, that period that the eye and brain can learn to talk is mostly over. there are some studies showing there may be some benefit to amblyopia treatment in certain types of people up into their mid teens (usually people who've never had any amblyopia treatment, and the later the amblyopia treatment starts, the less improvement can be expected). lasik doesn't affect amblyopia. you can think of lasik as getting your glasses prescription lasered into your cornea. it can't sharpen the vision in the amblyopic eye because the communication from eye to brain simply isn't there. another way to think about it is the eye being a camera that is connected to a computer via a cable. the cable is the optic nerve and the computer is the brain. amblyopia causes a problem in the computer itself. so everything else in the system looks normal but it still produces a blurry picture. you could put glasses or contacts on the camera, you could even do lasik on the camera, but there's still a processing problem causing the blurry vision. it doesn't mean you can't have lasik but it does mean your bear vision after the procedure is still limited.",reddit,0,0

9284,"since this post might be a little long i put a tldr at the bottom. some background: i have a really high prescription (10). i am in college away from home, so two weeks ago i went to an ophthalmologist to get a dilated exam to check on my retinas and get my yearly checkup. i wanted to get this appointment specifically with an ophthalmologist rather than an optometrist since i haven't noticed a significant change in vision (prescription wise) and since its been a few years since i was dilated. my last appointment before lockdown only did some imaging tests (i think an oct), and i remember i wasn't dilated. i am well aware of the risks of my high prescription and know the general symptoms to look out for (new floaters, flashes, dark curtain) if i need to drop everything and see an eye doctor. i have had floaters since i was 12. now here goes - i get flashes in the exact same spots, in both eyes, when i move them rapidly, particularly against bright white backgrounds. i was under the impression that flashes due to tears/detachments happen regardless of eye movement, and they are usually severe and apparent. i didn't know what i was seeing was ""flashes"" until i moved my eyes rapidly with the intent of seeing them, and compared this to a what i've been reading. well, now i can't un-see them. i notice them much more often now, but still only with rapid eye movements in bright settings. this was a major reason for the appointment. i am fairly certain i have been ""seeing"" these flashes for a few years. anyhow, here's how the appointment went. he did the visual tests for my prescription and only raised my prescription up a touch (after a ~~little~~ scare as i had never seen plus cylinder notation before), which was a little bit of a relief suggesting my prescription might be starting to stable out. i talked to him about the flashes, so he dilated my eyes, used a slit lamp, and in a separate test i remember him looking around in my eye, having me look all the way up, left, right, down, through a handheld bright light. he said my retina looked healthy, and that the flashes are likely due to the vitreous fluid tugging on my retina, which can be triggered by the rapid eye movement. he gave me my new prescription and sent me on my way. i lurk here and on similar subreddits, and have read some comments about the how direct ophthalmoscopy is limited in observing the periphery, versus say indirect ophthalmoscopy. i've also read some scare stories about tests like this missing tears in the far periphery which then progress into detachments. which, of course, gets me concerned. i am planning on getting another appointment with my regular optometrist when i get back home in a month anyway. so, my questions are: is direct ophthalmoscopy typically sufficient for identifying tears, holes, or the like? i know indirect ophthalmoscopy is generally better. is it urgent that i find a new appointment immediately with another eye doctor in town and get a more thorough test, or should i keep the one i have in a month? when i have my new appointment, what kinds of tests, if any, should i ask for? specific imaging? sorry about the length, and i apologize if questions like this aren't appropriate on this subreddit, but thank you for your help. tldr: high prescription. seen flashes for a few years. went to see an ophthalmologist very recently. doctor said i'm fine and attributed them to vitreous. is direct ophthalmoscopy sufficient in finding tears, and would it behoove me to get a second opinion urgently vs in a month?",reddit,0,0

9312,"don't let my comments discourage you! there's always options after you hit your 40s if you get lasik now. you can wear a contact lens in one eye, this is called mono vision. dominant eye to see distance, other eye to see near. or you can always opt for early cataract surgery. cataracts are your lenses that have hardened/grown in density (which is the reason why people need readers at age 40). when you undergo cataract surgery, a synthetic lens is inserted in your eyes, and basically you can get bifocal lenses implanted (so you have permanent bifocals in your vision to put it simply. this would eliminate your need for glasses). also, definitely have to add this disclaimer: everyone's eyes develop differently. you may not need reading glasses until you're 50, like my mom!",reddit,0,0

9324,"i've been having issues with my eyes and contacts for several months. at first i just chalked it up to allergies and increased usage of computers. i'm a teacher, and have always spent part of my day in front of a computer, but with covid it became all day. my right eye always seemed to be worse (which is why all the pictures below are of my right eye) and that is pretty status quo. if i'm having ear problems, my right ear is always the worst. i have intermittent pain in my right shoulder that i used to assume was some arthritis/inflammation from playing drums, but it seems to come and go in conjunction with my right ear and/or right eye inflammation. there are linked pictures below. it probably started closer to february but march is the earliest picture i kept. so around the end of may, i had both eye inflammation and ear inflammation. my right ear felt like it was being stabbed periodically, and my eyes had developed light sensitivity. (the may 31st picture). i figured a sinus infection with maybe an eye infection as well. also had a uti. no sinus pressure, though. went to urgent care. he said he didn't think the eyes were infected, but figured the inflammation was due to a sinus infection. gave me steroids and antibiotics. i stopped wearing contacts (actually stopped a few days before that). the eyes seemed to do well with the steroids and glasses. once the steroids were done after five days, i tried contacts again (brand new pair) and regretted it within a few hours. went to an optometrist and she said they were infected. gave me antibiotics and steroid eyedrops. no contact usage. after a week i went for a checkup and they recommended i taper off the eyedrops and could start wearing contacts again once i got to two drops a day. i waited until i completely finished tapering off the drops. that was about two or so weeks ago. i used to wear them about 14 - 16 hours a day. i'd take them off at night and switch to glasses when i watched tv/played video games and then wouldn't use them until i left for work the next day. now, since the infection, i actually wear them as little as possible. maybe 6-7 hours a day or less. mainly when i go out, because i hate how i look with my glasses. they're like... coke bottle thick. i never slept overnight with them. i do periodically fall asleep in them for an hour or so. never swim in them/shower in them. wash my hands before handling them, use a new contact case every time i put in a new pair, which is monthly. i wear soflens toric for astigmatism. ||**power**|**cyl**|**axis**|**bc**|dia| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |. right (od)| \-8.0|\-2.25|180.0|8.5|14.5 |. | left (os) |\-8.5 |\-2.75 |180.0 |8.5 |14.5| i use opti-free replenish contact lens solution multipurpose disinfecting solution. have been wearing contacts for about 20 years. only had maybe 2 or 3 eye infections the whole time.

9338,"ophthalmologist here. first, let me say that no licensed medical practitioner is going to give a pregnant woman medical advice over the internet--the potential medicolegal exposure is simply too great. so bearing in mind that i'm speaking in general terms, and am neither rendering a diagnosis nor making recommendations to you: brief flashing lights in the periphery of one eye are a classic manifestation of *vitreoretinal traction*, a condition wherein the jelly inside the back of the eye (the *vitreous*) is tugging on the neurosensory retina, usually in a far-peripheral location. the physical stimulation imparted to the retina by the tugging stimulates the photoreceptors, which do what photoreceptors do--they send a signal back to the brain, which interprets that signal as light flashes. by far, the #1 risk factor for vr traction is age. eyes 60 or so undergo changes that can lead to vr traction. in younger adults, severe diabetic retinopathy is probably the most common cause. high myopia (in the -10d range) is a risk factor in young adults as well, as is a history of significant ocular trauma. is there a relationship between vr traction and pregnancy? tangentially, yes. as mentioned, severe diabetic retinopathy can produce it. because pregnancy can accelerate diabetes, it is not unheard of for diabetic mothers to experience a significant worsening of diabetic retinopathy that culminates in vr traction. (that said: if a pregnant woman is getting good prenatal care and has never tested positive for diabetes, in the latter stages of pregnancy she is **not** going to suddenly get diabetes so bad that she develops vr traction.) here is an american academy of ophthalmology resource for flashes and floaters: [what are floaters and flashes? - american academy of ophthalmology (aao.org)](",reddit,0,0

9362,"i have high astigmatism and i was trying to get a replacement pair made quickly (since there is an issue with the coating on my current pair) but was getting quoted up to 10 working days since all the optical shops here have to get an offshore lab to handle high prescriptions. when i finally found a shop that quoted me 4-5 working days, the guy doing my eye test advised me that it was extremely unlikely for the lab to do it that quickly and i was looking at 10 working days. i suspect her colleague was quoting me a shorter time frame to close the sale. to make matters worse, finding a frame was extremely difficult. i'm not sure why but all the stores kept telling me they had very few metal frames with spring hinges and the ones that did were expensive $200+ frames which was outside my price range. when i gave up and chose a frame without spring hinges, i was warned that it was too narrow for me and it would be uncomfortable at the temples. i currently wear a pair that is 52-18 and the pair i wanted to buy was 54-16, but was told that the pair i wore had spring hinges which made it more comfortable. i was still about to place an order but was quoted 10 working days to get the lenses made and was advised not to proceed with the order if that was a problem for me. (most of the frames ive seen were the same size as the ones im wearing so im quite surprised they are too narrow for my face). at this point, it was past 9pm and all the other optical stores had closed for the day. the one upside was that the eye test i just did showed that my astigmatism was much lower than i thought it would be. i did an eye test a year ago that showed my left had a cylinder of -4.50 and the eye test i did today showed my left had a cylinder of -3.75. a small private practice that i went to earlier that day told me that if my cylinder was below -4.00, they might be able to get it done within 5 working days so i plan to go back to them tommorrow. i guess from now on i have to make sure to get a second pair whenever i get new glasses made to serve as a backup pair... its just too much of a hassle getting glasses done quickly when you have a high prescription.",reddit,0,0

9398,"hi guys, my rx hasn't changed in the last 9 years. i had always worn contact lenses, but in the last year had to start wearing glasses more frequently due to my eyes drying out/disorientation and extreme tiredness with the contacts in. i had the same pair for those 9 years (again, rarely wore them). the style is dated and the lenses are scratched, so after my optometry appt, i ordered a new pair. my old frames were plastic, rectangular and the lenses fairly thick (-4.75 and -5.0), but not heavy or noticeable to others. these were very comfortable for me. i received my new pair and can't wear them due to disorientation and distortion. i will also see an entire lampshade (if the light is on )in the corner of my glasses, when the light isn't in my peripheral vision. the lenses are thinner and less curved as well. this optometrist changed my axis from 110 to 134, despite me being told my mild astigmatism would have the same numbers (this was a new optometrist). not sure if that's an issue. these lenses also have nose pads and thus sit farther from my eyes, which i also dislike. the lenses are also much thinner (polycarbonate) and much less curved (my old glasses almost wrap around the outer corners of my eyes , which seems to help). they are also not as wide as my rectangular glasses, so perhaps this is part of the issue. i'm fine with these lenses as long as i don't turn my head or my eyes. once i do that, it's a dizzying mess. i'm trying to get the same lenses i had before, because while they aren't thin, they're comfortable and the way they look on me doesn't cause me to look bug eyed etc. any suggestions on what to look for? all i seem to be able to find available with my rx are polycarbonate/high index. i honestly don't know what my old lenses are made from (definitely not glass. i'm leaning towards regular plastic) and without seeing anything else as an option anywhere, i'm a little concerned. thank you and pardon my ignorance. nearly 10 yrs behind on lens updates, i guess i should've been updating my frames more often.",reddit,0,0
9399,"i would go with high index 1.67 if you were my patient. the smaller the frame, the thinner the lenses. high index lenses are thinnest at the center, so the thickest part will be at the lens edges. if you went with an aviator, or something close to being that large, you would have super thick lenses on the outside. also, a plastic frame will hide the lens edges much better than a metal frame. also, avoid poly if you want the least amount of distortion.",reddit,0,0
9400,"the retina stretches slowly over time as axial myopia progresses. this usually stops progressing in the late teens or early 20's. once it begins occurring there is no known way to completely stop it until it stops on it's own due to age. it can be slowed with eye drops or special contact lenses. wearing glasses that are too strong as a child can theoretically worsen myopic progression. but wearing glasses that are too weak or just right does not significantly affect myopic progression (although some data suggests wearing glasses that are just right is better than wearing glasses that are too weak, but the difference is pretty neglible).",reddit,0,0

9446,"the question has already been answered but just to add a little detail: there is no number at which you become blind once you hit it. optometry is part physics part health care. glasses correction is the physics part of it. as long as there is a focal point on your retina, and as long as the path to it is clear, and as long as the signal can reach your brain from your eyes, it is possible to correct it with glasses. if you are hypermetropic, plus powered, there is a limit to how high a power you will need because the eyeball is only so long. i'm not saying there's a limit to how high we can correct, rather i'm saying there's a limit to how high we'll ever need to correct. so you don't really see people with plus power that goes that high. if you are myopic, negative power, the number needed can get much higher to correct your vision. i've seen as high as -29, and i'm sure others have seen higher. it definitely is a little more difficult to correct vision that high, partially because the higher your correction needs to get the less likely to doctor will have the lenses on hand to neutralize it in an exam. but also because the higher your prescription gets, the more likely other factors such as minification and vertex distance will have a significant impact on your correction. but it is still possible to correct vision that high. as i said as long as there is a focal point and there's a clear path to it and their is signal to the brain then you can correct it with glasses. some diseases, like cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, corneal scarring, and others cause the clear tissues that let light into the eye to become cloudy or opaque. because light can't pass through, no matter how strong or weak your glasses are, that would be considered blindness. other diseases, like macular degeneration or retina detachment, causes the focal point to be ""crumpled up"" for lack of a better word. that can also cause blindness. and yet other diseases, such as stroke, glaucoma, brain tumors, can affect the optic nerve which connects your eyes to your brain. in this case there's nothing wrong with the eyes but you're still blind because the brain gets no signal. high prescriptions are associated with higher risk of eye diseases. so it's definitely true that if you have a really high prescription you are more likely to go blind, but there's no amount of prescription that guarantees you to go blind. and overall the average risk to any single person of going blind is pretty low and can usually be avoided with routine eye exams.",reddit,0,0

9482,does a millimeter or two more of optical zone increase the overall size of the iol by very much? this is a good question. i'm not qualified to do more than guess at it though. the high power lenses (like sn60wf 29 d) already require a larger incision because of their thickness. i imagine the overall thickness centrally will continue to increase as the diameter increases. then we run into folding issues if the optic is larger. also how do you compensate for the haptics? make them smaller? they might become weaker. now you might mess with centration. this would require a whole lot of r and d and $$$ on top of the fda approval process. and it's a big risk - what if after everything there's no significant reduction in side effects? again just not worth the risk given the low incidence of complaints in the first place.,reddit,0,0
9483,"hi, i have a mystery i could use your help with. about 2 months ago when i was wearing monthly contacts, i noticed i had these two redspots in my right and left eye that didn't look quite right. there was no pain or anything. maybe the ocassional itch. this was after 4 months of wearing the contacts with no issues. of note, the week before this happened i did overwear my contacts - some days for 12/13 hours. i also work in it so i'm at a computer most of the day. eventually, the redness seemed to be isolated to just my right eye when i put in contacts. left eye was totally fine with contacts.

9639,"hello i have been experiencing dizziness for more than 4 years. but what i mean by dizziness is something different from what dizziness really is. it is not like you are spinning or so. imagine that you are holding your phone horizontal and have opened the camera. just shake it gently and then just stop doing so and hold it normally. that is the kind of experience i am suffering. years ago i had an mri test and nothing came up and as well i had a balance test to check my inner ear and nothing came up either. so i thought that it would be psychological but i have had a time when i needed to use antidepressants and i really benefited from them but that dizziness problem didn't go away. so i think too it has nothing to do with my psychology and it was just a short time i am totally fine. i have an high astigmatism and myopia like 7. i have been using glasses more than 10 years. every optician i visited said that dizziness has nothing to do with eyes and my eye tests came up pretty good like retina, corneal tests, etc. it has really no pattern like it happens when i am sitting or walking or whatever. but what i noticed is that it tends to be worse when i use computer more than usual. it is like the veins in my eyes have a kind of pressure on them. in extreme cases of that dizziness, the vision or the environment spins so fast that i feel like holding an object and it lasts 5-10 seconds and during that time it is like my brain gets lighter and you know like something is being extracted from my brain but when it stops this feeling goes. it is the extreme and continual version of that telephone camera example and it happens rarely. i feel uncomfortable in my daily life because i have continuous fear that that may happen while driving or crossing roads etc. i also suspect that it may be due to some problems in my neck area or so but i have no posture problems or neck pain or so. that dizziness sometimes even happen in bed like just lying. do you know the feeling you are falling down in your dream and wake up jumping? yeah that is exactly what is happening sometimes though it is extremely rare but very unpleasant. have anyone experienced. something like that please let me know and share your experiences/guesses etc. thank you edit1: i have seen an optician for routine check and my eye numbers are same for 1 year or so. however i have noticed long time ago that with my right eye (which has a higher number like 7+ astigmat than my left eye which is like 5+ astigmat) i see worse. is it normal because i can't read the same things that i can read with my left eye. aren't glasses supposed to correct vision? or the high number difference between my eyes causes so ? is it somehow related to dizziness? i was about to ask this to my optician but i was so desperate that i forgot :( ( i have to say that i see well with my glasses but it is just one eye closed observation of mine hope i expressed myself well) edit 2: i was a kind of person who used to spend more than 5 hours in front of a screen however for 2-3 years i am using it when necessary and for a short period of time. can it be related to that fact like my eyes can't handle it anymore ? has it become oversensitive and maybe somehow causes my eye veins to overwork and put pressure on them and this in turn makes me dizzy.",reddit,0,0
9640,"i'll start off by saying that i realize am in a very fortunate position compared to many here. this isn't a post to brag but rather hopefully give some insight to those that may be where i was a few years ago. keratoconus runs in my family (my mom has had a transplant in each eye) so it was always something that i had been terrified of getting. i was always very diligent in bringing it up to my eye doctor any time i had an appt. about 6 years ago, i got the update that i'd need to go see an opthalmologist who specializes in keratoconus. sure enough shortly after, i was diagnosed. the good news was that it was still early. i was still able to see 20/20 with glasses, but i knew it was a race against the clock for me. at the time, the us wasn't fully approved for cxl so i made sure to be even more diligent in getting routine exams until it was. after it became approved in the us, about 3 years ago, i got cxl in my ""bad"" eye and a few months after that got it in my ""good"" eye. now every time i go see the eye doctor, i'm paranoid that my eyes are still progressing and that cxl wasn't effective for me. however, last week during my yearly exam, my eye doctor told me that my prescription and eyes have stabilized and there was very little change from the year before. i was over the moon! not only that, she was now able to fit me with (non-custom) soft contacts for astigmatism!!! (like what people without keratoconus wear!) i almost cried right there in the office. again, i realize that i'm in a very rare position and that seeing 20/20 with glasses let alone wearing soft contacts is out of the question for many. but i just wanted to share this because early detection and treatment was key for me. with keratoconus, it's not a matter of if, but when and how fast your eyes get worse. yes, even possibly in an eye that may be ""good"" right now. if you're on the fence about cxl, and your doctor is advising you to get it, imo it's absolutely worth the pain and frustration for a few months after.

9717,"i appreciate your help with anything you can give me. even if it's just a referral to another person. i'll chase it down! i am in a quandary. i have never worn glasses because i needed to, just because they helped me read at a distance while driving. i see just fine in the day and the majority of things at night without them. they help with nighttime reading at a distance for small details. in my opinion, i see fine. no ghosting, no seeing double, no issues focusing, no halos, no streaking, no bent (straight) lines. at a distance at night, finer details are much better with glasses on, but that is really it. i am trying to join the service as a pilot and i passed the initial exam for correction 20/20, no colorblindness, no depth issues, and a prescription within tolerance. i, being my proactive minded self, went to get my eyes evaluated for lasik because i knew i had astigmatism. this is when i had my first corneal topography done. the nurse said i had irregular astigmatism (she believed i have keratoconus (kc)) and i needed to see the ophthalmologist. \*caveat here, kc isn't just disqualifying for a pilot slot, but for joining the military altogether. the only position in all of the military that requires a corneal topography is pilot\* fast forward a few weeks to the doctor's visit. the doc is very well respected and the only corneal specialist in my area. i believe his words to me were something like ""i am giving you a very liberal diagnosis with your topography scans as an 'irregular astigmatism' and the fact that you are easily correctable to 20/20. if i were to diagnose you with kc, it will follow you forever, which is not what i want for you if you can still get in the service with a different position if they don't do the scans. i fear a military ophthalmologist may not see you the same way i do and write you off with kc and you can never get in, not just as a pilot. you might go about a happy career with 0 issues, or they have you get corneal cross-linking done later on if it were to become an issue and that's it. many pilots have it and never know until they are 40 and they finally find it.""<u+009d> i just don't want to give up on my dream or a chance to get there is a possibility. i feel like he was doing me a favor by not giving me the kc label to get in. i have already been selected for a pilot do to my scores, so i need to make a decision to accept or decline for a different position asap. i have attached my most recent scans, recent measurements. looking for opinions you can give, thank you in advance, jpg? width=4018&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa669e299c38ad80d6f519e221c2edeb7e1e60b9 jpg? width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35aec5b9a897fe457fb06214532545f502c2113c jpg? width=3740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=213259712ddbda3a310560e1d4117ba4251160a9 jpg? width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc0690bfea3a1767fdab3ca91b40789012d61179.",reddit,0,0

9722,"hi all. i am in my mid 30ies, i believe my keratoconus was diagnosed in my teenage years, when cxl wasn't a thing yet. my mother has kcn, too, but apparently it never progressed as fast as mine: 12 years ago, i had a (dalk) cornea transplant in my right eye. left eye remained stable for the next ten years, and now changed a little because i decided to get epi-on cxl (that's another long story). back in the day, as soon as they saw the kcn was getting really bad, they just gave me the usual ""get rgp lenses"" spiel. that's what i did, and i hated them. even got an infection on my right eye because of the rgp scracting the cornea. not long after, the transplant happened, and i stopped wearing them alltogether. some time after, an optician suggested i should try soft toric lenses. actually, they worked pretty well. on my transplanted eye, i got 8/10, on my kcn eye 10/10. wow! in general, my eyes are pretty sensitive, and i have to say, even with soft contacts i couldn't wear them all day. i had my tricks, like: morning with glasses, as soon as the eyes get too tired (because of the strain of working in front of a monitor), switch to contacts. sometimes if i went out in the afternoon and came back at night, i would them on before going out, and late at night my eyes would get so dry, no matter how many eye drops i would put. but aside from these issues, the soft toric lenses served me well. now my (vertical) coma got really bad on my left eye after cxl, and wanted to try sclerals. i have a few questions for you guys: \- does anybody wear sclerals on the graft? how long can you wear it? i read online how the hypoxia from the scleral (even with very very high dk, and with a thin reservoir) can cause problems to the graft. i have a beautiful dalk that served me well for the latest 12 years, and even if vision is not ""optimal"", i think it's still better than risking graft rejection. what is your experience? \- what about kcn? did anybody try prose and eyeprint pro? these seem like the ""best"" brands doing custom sclerals. how do they fare? how would you compare them to hybrid lenses? thanks in advance for sharing your experience!",reddit,0,0

9764,"# introduction hi all, i'm a chinese student studied in germany currently. i have been disturbed by dry eyes syndrom from a very long time, 8 years approximately since i bought my first laptop. i work in the software industry. needless to say, my daily screen time easily exceeds 8 hours. so, it's a simple truth that if you have dry eyes then quit facing screens for such a long time. every doctor says that, and everyone knows that, but that's something out of our control. computer is a productivity tool for people like me, i can't quit my job and go live in a mountain, right? i thought asians are more prone to suffer from dry eyes, i once read a statistic report about that. anyway, i'll just cut my crap and share what me (and people i know with similar problems) have already found out. # diagnose ##. self diagnose first of all, you should know the current condition of your eyes. here is a very simple way to diagnose yourself. according to severity of eyes' condition, the symptoms can be categorized into 3 levels: 1. light: you can read real paper book (or newspaper, magazine, anything like that) for as long time as you want. you doesn't feel a thing while reading. but you eyes are feeling difficult while using a mobile phone or work in front of a screen monitor. 2. medium: hours of book reading make your eyes tired. not to mention screen monitors. 3. severe: even openning your eyes is difficult. you want to secrete more tears but no, there is just no tears in eyes, not if you yawn or cry. you especially hate windy weather outside, because it leads to your sore and painful eyes. guys, i'm not here to terrify you, there symptoms are what actually happened between us. and don't be desperate, i'm here to spread my experience. ## hospital diagnose you can also go to hospital, there are a bunch of machines made for this. i guess it won't costs much. in china, it costs roughly 50 dollars (chinese yuan converted to usd). with the help of machines, you'll get a report and some data about your eye condition: 1. how long can your tear film lasts each time you close and reopen your eyes? 2. what is the amount of tear you have in your eyes? 3. did you eye glands that secrete tears shrink or becoming distorted? these information is helpful, at least you need to know what happened to your eyes. sorry for the amateur description, i'm not familiar with medical terms, especially in english. # do's and don'ts ##. what to do? you can of course go to see the doctor, and often times you will have to try many doctors. in china, it seems that there is no mature way to cure dry eyes. what the eye doctor will do is let you try several kinds of eyedrops, and they often don't work well. remember, if you are using any kind of eyedrops, just make sure they are absolutely preservative free. also there are some mini-scale surgeries like smartplug and lipiflow, they are quite more expensive than eyedrops. as far as i know these surgeries are not that helpful, but you can talk with your doctors and know more. i can roughly explain most of methods eye doctors would use, how does it work and why it's not so useful etc. but let's just move on to next paragraph, because i don't really have a positive attitude toward these methods. i don't know if there are different approaches used by doctors in western countries, so don't entirely take my words before ask the doctor for help. the most valuable thing you can do is to limit your screen time. i know there are factors other than screen that cause dry eyes, yes i know, but as long as you already have dry eyes symdrom then quit using screen should improve your condition instantly. the second valuable thing is doing exercises, outdoor exercises are better. the third is sleeping enough. other things like quit masterbating or get some xanthophyll and eat fresh foods might help or might not, i don't know. three things above are proved to work well. ## don't do! 1. don't use any screen or mobile phone in a dark room! 2. don't get stick to the screen while your eyes are already shouting out loud: help! 3. don't use any eyedrops contain preservative! 4. don't try any eye surgeries before fully informed by doctors! # silver bullet is there a silver bullet, like it can cure it all? the answer is yes and no. ## yes, there is a silver bullet here comes the most important part of this post. a simple truth, what harms your eyes is the light source. it's not about the screen per se, it's the light source that lit the screen. so, if you are using kindle to read books, it should be quite comfortable for you eyes. reading e-ink paper without turning on its back light is just as reading real paper. what's the problem with iphones, laptops, screen monitors? it's the led inside the screen that harms our eyes. as far as i know there is only one another type of screen that doesn't have led: rlcd screens. rlcd screens are often used in outdoor advertisement. the problems with e-ink are the low refresh rate and limited color display. e-ink screen is just not acceptable if you are using it to work or do any kind of serious learning. what we have found out is to remove the led inside the screen monitor and use natural light as the light resource to lit the screen. it's not easy to do, but you'll get familiar after you have one or two experience dismantling it. not all screen monitors are good for this, make sure it uses a tn panel, not ips, not va, not oled, it should be tn. tn panel has better transparency. don't be scared, indoor lighting using led won't harm, as long as the light doesn't directly shot into your eyes (like while you're using screens) then it should be fine. ## no, there is no silver bullet after you remove all harmful light source from screens, your eyes should make big improvement. but are they cured? sorry, the answer is a no. for people have level 3 symptoms, you still need to rest your eyes as much as possible. i don't have a strict rule for everyone, just don't overuse it. things like sleeping and doing exercises are big pluses to your eyes, things like overusing your eyes, especially using normal led lit screens are big minuses to your eyes. increase more pluses and decrease more minuses, then you should get through this fucking tricky disease, even without using any drugs or surgeries. if your eyes just feel really dried up, you can use hylo tear drop or use a hot towel to very lightly touch you eyes. --- here we should put a period to this post, i think it's just already so long. i know there are many details i didn't expand into, so if you have any questions please leave comments below, i'll check regularly and see if i can help.",reddit,0,0

9766,"i have struggled with insomnia for the last ten years, although it would be somewhat sporadic and especially get bad around my cycle. through sleep hygiene and supplements i have had it mostly under control and slept well during 2020 when i was unemployed. however, now i am working full time (on the computer) and have been dealing with severe dry eye symptoms for the last 6 months, my sleep is absolutely wrecked. especially in the last month. i only get 3 maybe 4 hours of sleep. then i have middle of the night freakouts and i can't calm down. because i know my body needs sleep in order for my eyes to heal. it's a viscous cycle. my normal sleep stack of mag glycinate, deep sleep herbal formula and melatonin just don't work anymore. yesterday eve, i felt really calm. had a nice yoga session after work, took a shower, made a cup of tea, listened to audio books. i felt calm and sleepy but when i try to sleep i get these surges of adrenaline my skin feels hot and rubbery. i've also been doing sleep restriction technique which had worked well for me in the past but not anymore. does anyone know of any rx medications to help you sleep or calm an anxiety attack that dries out eyes the least? even though i'm at a better place in my dry eye journey than i was a few months ago, this shit has really taken a toll on my mental health.",reddit,0,0

9778,"i don't want to overwrite your doctor, especially because i'm a 3rd year student and absolutely lack the expertise he/she has. here is my opinion nonetheless... and it would be easier to give you an answer if you specified which eye was feeling these effects... the right one, or both? i'm guessing it's just the right eye thats giving you trouble, yes? if not, disregard the rest... for an eye with +6.50 - 0.50 x 120 ...i probably wouldn't even touch that cyl and just give you the sphere (like your doctor did). but if you *do* in fact need it, then my next guess would be that the lens is rotating on your eye. every time you blink, the contact lens' ballast/orientation mechanism is rotating it to the correct axis, and then it drifts off again a second or so later. this is probably super difficult, but if you have a magnifying glass (and a flashlight) and you have really keen sight, try to find that inferior marking on your contact lens while wearing it in front of a mirror. see if it isn't in the same spot right after blinking, and a few seconds later. a total longshot, but can't hurt to try. if you're committed to having contact lenses and can't get any soft ones to work, then you can always try rgps.",reddit,0,0

9792,"hi all, i found out in march that i have keratoconus (one of my parents does as well) after my vision in my right eye drastically reduced over the past year and i went to the eye doctor to get a new glasses prescription (i'm in my late 20s). the eye doc was unable to get me back to 20/20 vision even with lenses, but i feel pretty lucky that i can see/read fairly well still, at least during the day. however, i've noticed my vision get worse even just since march. i wonder if the increased amount of screen time from working from home, etc. during quarantine could have played a role? regardless, it's made me realize i need to prioritize seeing a specialist and potentially pursue cxl. so my question - how did you all go about choosing your specialist? i'm in philadelphia so i should have a number of options (i could also pursue treatment in houston where my family is based), but i'm a bit overwhelmed after an initial round of searching. are there any specific questions you asked, such as whether they had done many cxl procedures in the past? is there some sort of eye-specific directory i could start with? and did anyone's insurance pay for any of this at all, or should i plan to handle this all out of pocket? thanks for any insight or advice you might have! as i'm sure you've all experienced, this is overwhelming to wrap your head around at first. appreciate this community for sure.",reddit,0,0
9793,"i would say get treatment asap. if some piece is still in there that's irritating you, it needs to be checked. i had a contact lense reaction that ended up in an ulcer. i'm not saying that's what you have, just that it can get bad quickly. your eyes are really not worth risking. depending on where you live call your gp or national health line for advice on where to go. in the uk it would be nhs 24, but i don't know where you live so check what's available.",reddit,0,0

12008,"the reason i'm scarred - i don't know if anybody will care for this story or even if what i'm going to say is allowed. but i was married once. the only reason i ever found someone was because they found me. it was someone i worked with. i wasn't 100% attracted to this person, but someone out there wanted me. i think i even turned her down at first, but then i started to see her differently and we started going out. i was also sick of living at home and wanted out so i moved in with her. everything happened so fast. we moved to another state and got married way too fast. but i had a problem, that i still have today. i sometimes have trouble (cough cough) getting off, even if i'm just masturbating. i still don't know what causes it. my doctor has no answers either. but my wife was not helpful at all when it happened. not at all. most times she would say stupid stuff like, it's me isn't it, you don't find me attractive enough. that just made things worse. and it wasn't always that. some things would help it happen but she wasn't helpful in doing those things. besides my problem, we were incompatible. the things she said to me made me not even want to have sex with her anymore. then i got a computer (back in the early days of the internet) and i got addicted to it and stopped paying attention to her and then eventually she asked for a divorce. now besides having severe social anxiety i have always had a fear of hooking up with someone because of my problem, what if it happens again. i feel like i'd have to explain my whole life story to someone before i could hook up with anybody. i'm too afraid. it's going on 20 years since then and i barely leave the house. i haven't spoken to her since then either, but wouldn't want to.",reddit,0,0

12016,"""you must be awful at talking to girls if you look the way you do and are desperate haha"" - i was catching up with an old friend who recently got engaged. he asked me about my girl situation, so i told him that i had a few dates here and there that lead to nothing and haven't really found anything serious. being in my late 20's, all my friends are married or engaged and at this point i've been starting to feel desperate. he then says ""you must be awful at talking to girls if you look the way you do and are desperate haha"", and he's so right it hurts. social anxiety and low confidence is ruining my life, also doesn't help that i'm an introvert. i'm horrible at talking to people, getting to know them, making them feel good, making myself seem interesting, making genuine connections, etc. i basically black out and forget to do/say even the most basic things like introducing myself. i live in the heart of a city, in college, consistently flooded with tinder/bumble/okcupid matches, always complimented on my looks, and surrounded by people everywhere i go like on the subway, on campus, and the office, so knowing what my life could be like bums me out because i'm just wasting all this opportunity. you'd think with all those things on my side i'd have no problem, but the problem is me. i'm afraid to initiate conversations in person, and the rare times i do it pretty much bombs and gets awkward pretty quickly. i just feel so ""alone in a crowded room"" all the time. how can i get out of this rut and thrive in social situations? it's not even just people i'm attracted too, it's pretty much anyone, any age, any gender. i think it's talking to someone, one on one, that's the worst for me because i have to be 100% engaged and the spotlight is on me which makes me uncomfortable. i do a little better in small groups of 3-4 people because there's less pressure on me to keep things moving. what can i do to build confidence and not panic when speaking with someone? i know it takes practice, but i need more advice than ""just go out and talk to people!""",reddit,0,0

12215,"here's a bit of advice for you: just relax. she's been your friend for 15+ years, and even though you've had a bit of distance between you and your friend, 8 months will not erase 15+ years of friendship. trust me, she will not be annoyed or upset by you texting her and you won't overwhelm her with your problems. as for the fear of sending that first message, maybe send it just before you sleep, so that you won't feel super anxious about when your friend will respond. i recommend sticking your phone far away from your bed and turning on do not disturb on it, so you don't feel tempted to check it every time that it buzzes. i'd recommend scheduled sending, but i believe the app that does this requires a paid subscription, but if you feel more comfortable with a scheduled send, then go for it. scheduling important emails to be sent out while i'm asleep has been super helpful for my anxiety (a strategy that i used this for would be my lors this week), so if you feel like sending a scheduled text helps and you are willing to pay a small fee, then go for it. as for the anxiety and fear that you feel both before and after, just know this: it's alright if your friend doesn't respond immediately. maybe they are busy or have something on the side, but know this: there is a reason you guys have been friends for 15+ years and she will respond to you, so have faith in yourself. i hope that this first text between you and your friend goes well and you guys will be able to rebuild and reconnect, and i sincerely hope that you have a great weekend!",reddit,0,0

12255,"first of all, i'm really impressed by how aware and reflective you are about your own feelings and behaviors, as well as how you're trying to continually work on yourself. i've struggled with depression all my life and social anxiety for about 15 years, and it's often felt like i can't do anything to change it -- i mean, often i can't when episodes are at their peak. however, i've learned various triggers and ways of controlling things that do influence my depression and anxieties. and a lot takes practice and patience. i think you clearly are practicing and seem to have a lot of patience. what i would be worried about is thinking of it in terms of molding yourself to become a ""better"", ""less awkward"", ""normal"" person, as opposed to keeping your ""creepy shell"" on. while it can be good to try to learn to adjust your behaviors and how you express yourself in order to come across as more socially adept and not as awkward, stressing this too heavily might lead to self-judgment about things you don't need to judge yourself for, like (1) things you do that are awkward in themselves and not because of you or (2) things that aren't awkward for other people but that you feel are awkward. as an example of (1), often times co-workers (who are not independently great friends) will feel pressure to make small talk when they first come into the office. this is often awkward for a lot of people. i, for one, find small talk really awkward, and in these contexts i've tended to be excessively focused on my own expressions of my feeling awkwardness -- which in turn leads me to behave outwardly even more awkwardly. i have tried in the past to make myself more sociable and take control of the conversation, and found some success at times; but honestly, i find myself less capable of doing this when my depression and anxieties are significantly high. something i found that works better for me is to learn to be comfortable with this kind of awkwardness. it takes a lot of patience, but i've been feeling less anxiety in these situations. that office small talk example could work as an example of (2) as well, because i've become friends with some people who i work with who eventually tell me that i wasn't awkward at all -- even though i distinctly remember it *feeling awkward and behaving obviously awkward*. a lot of the things you mention in your first list seem to be things that are just inherently, or very often, awkward for all parties involved. flirting with someone is awkward for most, i'm pretty sure (it is for me!); getting rejected is as well (fuck me ded); being in a conversation where someone leaves you on read is awkward (dear god, it's me...); etc. i think it's okay to feel awkward in these situations. if it's important to you to flirt with your crush, not let rejection get you down, etc., i think one big part of it will be learning to be more comfortable in these awkward situations. i like your example of flirting and then feeling like you made the conversation uncomfortable and then opening up about that. i think the most neutral response would be not to mention the feeling that the convo is now uncomfortable, but it seems that it's an important feeling you have atm. it's good that you notice it, but also it doesn't seem to bad to even express that to someone or to add the disclaimer that you tend to overthink these things. that kind of ""word vomit"" is genuine and honest and, imo, not awkward. those who say it's awkward probably have in mind a person who is not gaston and not overly confident about everything. tl;dr: the point i'm taking way too long to make is that trying to inhibit your dispositions to express your anxieties or feeling of awkwardness is sometimes unnecessary (because the awkwardness is due to the situation) and potentially quite unhealthy (because you may end up feeling terrible for not successfully inhibiting all of those dispositions). moreover, although you can definitely find success at modualting the way you express your feelings and thoughts in general, i'm a firm believer in the idea that mental states like depression and anxiety are very robust and will find a way to express themselves. so just inhibiting them can potentially create a bunch of pain. it all depends on the full story of you, but it's something you should keep in mind. so, sure, try and learn to feel *okay* when someone leaves you on read -- that may help you in similar situations in the future (like emotional weigh lifting!) -- but also be sure to attend to your feelings and how bad it would feel to keep them in vs. how good it would feel to let them out organically.",reddit,0,0

12509,"how can i help my brother with social anxiety? - hi everyone. im cross posting from r/relationships to get as much help as i can on this. im at a loss of how to help him and perhaps need a different perspective. my brother (15m) wasnt always like this. when he was younger, he was able to talk to others without a hitch and could even make friends easily (or more easily than now). over the last four or so years, hes gotten more and more reclusive and hides away in his room unable to talk to others besides our immediate family. he dreads presentations at school, hides away in the library at lunch to avoid talking to/being around others, cant order things he needs whether its food or talking to a cashier, etc. he is unable to ask questions in his classes to his teachers and his grades arent that great. the most alarming signs are that he seeks food as a comfort to the point where hes overweight now and he tried to self harm by cutting himself around last year but i thankfully caught it in the early stages and hes since stopped. hes turned to video games as well and barely speaks to us. its incredibly difficult for him to open up and share his feelings and im worried most about that aspect. im the closest to him and yet its like pulling nails to get him to tell me whats wrong and that hed rather keep it all to himself. ive tried to intervene and help him by taking him on a shopping spree to make him feel better about himself and spend time with him everyday so he knows he has someone who he can always come to for anything. ive taken him to my therapist (more like forced him to come with me) and he opened up but isnt all that keen on going back and continuing. ive tried to get him to do activities with me so hed get some exercise in because i know if hed get moving, hed feel a whole lot better in general. he refuses and wont come along with me so im really at a loss about this issue. our parents swear nothing is wrong even though theres clearly an issue and im afraid if he continues like this, itll take a lot longer to correct. i dont want him to get bullied or hurt because of this; he has a soft heart and it would destroy me. what are some things i can do to help him? everything ive tried hasnt really come to fruition but i dont want to give up. tldr: brother refuses any help i offer to help improve his condition. im all out of ideas to help but dont want to give up.",reddit,0,0

12513,"someone posted this yesterday and also had a misleading title. it's not cbt it is related to cbt. they called it (the author of the study) metacognitive therapy developed specifically for social anxiety treatment. which may be splitting hairs, and also the whole thing doesn't even matter much because... there were only 100 participants in the beginning. they were split into 4 groups. so each experimental group has about 25 participants. at the end after dropout there were more like 20. how confident are we that comparing one group of 20 to other groups of 20 can be extrapolated to all people with sad? also, if you look at the numbers, the people on medication improved more than people only receiving placebo. so the medication is doing *some* improving (according to their own little study). so what broad conclusions can be drawn by psychology? probably something like, intriguing small preliminary clinical study. future larger studies replicating this study should be done. i mean, it's interesting to me as someone into psychology science. but most laypeople are just going to use this study as ""scientific proof"" that confirms their already held bias against ssri treatment for anxiety.",reddit,0,0

""erm... is this for me?"", she said. ""uh, yeah, that's yours"" i said a little too quickly as i walked off. ""ok...thank you"", she replied, looking at me as if i was a total weirdo. which i was, i suppose. anyway, that's just another memory that'll keep me awake at night for the next 20 years. this post was mainly to vent and i can't imagine anyone reading this far, but if you did then thank you. maybe you can relate, or maybe you found it entertaining. if stuff like this happens to you then just know that you're not alone. have a nice night/day i guess.",reddit,0,0

12959,"confrontation catalyst. - i moved in with my sister and her mixed family because it was supposed to be a better environment for me than living with my mother, an alcoholic who threatened me daily and her new hobo boyfriend. which is another long story. i hate confrontation. but i keep my sister updated on everything that's happening when she leaves so she has a run down on all she missed and i have health problems and her kids treat me like another child, not an authority figure so shit goes down often. i not important but there is one awkward thing. her new stepson, a 13 year old, has been inappropriate with me. not letting me go in long hugs, his penis poking into me. i always try to delicately remove myself from the situation and not being attention that i notice because i didn't think it was on purpose. but then one day i got tired of it, struggles out and he ""accidentally"" groped my chest. i, an assaulted person, push him away from me. a few days later, my sister has to address the situation and he says he didn't mean to and i said bull and he's trying to wiggle his way out of it and i'm regretting letting her know the kids were fighting over old fast food they hid in their room and her other kid watching inappropriate shows and her other other kid refusing to do homework and i'm stressed which makes my condition worse and i literally have chest pains. and then her fiance says ""everyone keep their hands to themselves"" and starts talking about tickleing. i've had to physically wrestle the kid away from his much younger step siblings, even with my poor health and smaller stature. when things are going bad i de- escalate by tickling the kids sides, or when i'm being held against my will i've tickled him off and away from me, or i tickle because the kids are happy little gremlins and they started shit. idk it's tickling. i had an uncle who tickled too hard literally and potentially figuratively and i would never go too far or touch anywhere other than their sides/underarms and never for longer than it takes for them to move away/ say stop which i respect. his son groped me. was being inappropriate with me. and i asked my sister to do something about it because i can't even look a waitress in the eyes and i felt anxious being around my own nephew who i treated like i would any little kid in the family. and he was low-key trying to imply i'm a pedo? or interested in flirting? why would i ask my sister to do something if i wanted it - which is what it felt like he was implying. i'm upset. i feel embarrassed. i feel like he asked me ""what were you wearing tho."" i'm just going to let them get away with murder. it's easier than dealing with this shit.",reddit,0,0
12966,"i think internalized shame is culprit here. your explanations of your past are described in terms of shame. anxiety is more about not being able to handle the pressure. your examples are more about hiding yourself from the world, because you feel ashamed of yourself, and then add all negative experiences to that framework, reinforcing it even further. \&gt;i'm still 13, no girls want to date me \&gt;i'm 16 with braces, the sure girls won't date me \&gt;i'm 18 it's too late i'm too inexperienced. \&gt;i've missed x and y this is not how someone with anxiety describes his world -they talk how they've been scared by a prospect of meeting a girl, how you've couldn;t say anything in simple situation. to me it looks like perfectionism and shame - you consider yourself ""never good enough as you are"". too inexperienced, too old, don't have a car etc etc. you are building the wall of excuses which allow you to take responsibility off your shoulders. it's not you - it's late start. people intimidate you because your defenses crumble - they see you as a man, but you hide yourself behind phantoms and spooks. discard bullshit patterns of thinking like missing out - you've made a choice to miss those out, own it.",reddit,0,0
12974,"this might seem dismissive but i promise im not trying to be, but youre 15. youre really young. youve still got so much time ahead of you, practically your whole life. and you know what? youve already made the first steps in tackling this issue. youve already made progress! theres still more to go, more progress to be made, but like i said, youre really young and have time and options. good luck, you can do it!",reddit,0,0
12978,"as someone else mentioned, i think part of the anxiety for me as a person in their 20's (and it sounds like the same for you) is that there is the pressure to ""live your life to the fullest"" in your teens and 20's. and while that would be the ideal, it's not always feasible for someone dealing with anxiety and depression or other mental health issues. it's important to recognize that the things that people without these added pressures can do is not necessarily achievable for you right now, and that's not necessarily a bad thing; everyone goes at their own pace, and everyone needs help doing it. therapy is (slowly) helping me come to terms with that. have you talked with your 3 friends about your struggles with anxiety? i've lost friendships as well because of my anxiety and depression, and the emotional breakdowns that resulted from it. a lot of them ended due to a lack of proper communication because of said issues. maybe having an honest dialogue with your pals will help take off some of the weight of feeling like a ""nightmare.""",reddit,0,0
12993,"i know i have the least social anxiety around people who i care the least what they think about me. honestly, for me, it's old ladies. any type of ""popular-looking"" or ""well-adjusted looking"" person within 15 years older or younger than me can give me social anxiety, women especially.",reddit,0,0
12998,"i don't think exposure works for me either. i was a volunteer firefighter for 14 years. i had initially hoped it would help with my shyness and social awkwardness, but towards the end of my ""career"" my anxiety had gotten so bad that i couldn't even attend training meetings. i also work in retail and find that daily interactions with people do absolutely nothing to make me more comfortable with daily interactions with people. it sucks.",reddit,0,0

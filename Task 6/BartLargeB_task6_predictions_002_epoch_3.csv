8810,ok so i came back from the retina specialist today. he diagnosed me with a mild hyphema and i am treating it as we speak. i'm not nervous about the hyphema but about the possibility of getting glaucoma. i am only 15 and i never had any eye problems. i was hit with a ball. i heard if pressure is built up for a while it can cause glaucoma. my vision actually came back a few hours after trauma but when i was trying to go to bed i think the hyphema bled again. my vision was blurry again. it was already midnight so i just slept on it. when i woke up it was still blurry so i immediately went to the eye doc in the morning. he said my eye pressure was super high and gave me eye drops to bring it down. today i went to the retina specialist and he said i had no viewable retina damage. (took an ultrasound) and also didn't think there was any optic nerve damage. my peripheral vision is not black or cut off i still have my full field of vision but everything is blurry. the blurriness has gotten a little better. which the doc said is the blood from hyphema but i just wanna ask you guys if it could possibly be glaucoma and if i should ask.,reddit,1,1,0.0004706223,0.99952936

8889,"i work at specsavers (lab tech). i can't say much about the probable lens thickness, as in order to calculate it i'd need the pds from your prescription. then i could know the approximate thickness at the edges. the dispensing optician should have taken these measurements, and if you ever want to find out you can call them and ask for it, they are required by law to provide you this information per request in the eu. i have trouble understanding how such thin metal glasses would actually help with the lenses not appearing thick to answer your question here, a thicker plastic frame could potentially mask the lens thickness, but the actual lens inside would still be just as thick. but the second frame you got recommended will actually have thinner lenses despite also being a thin metal rim frame. let me explain: lenses for myopic (shortsighted) people are thinnest at the centre, and as you go outwards toward the edges, they get thicker. [this image]( illustrates what i mean quite well. by suggesting a smaller diameter frame (which the second one is), you basically guarantee that the lenses will be cut out into a smaller shape, meaning thinner at the edges. so yes, the second frame is a much better choice for you. to sum up, there isn't a lot you can do besides going for an even smaller frame, which i undestand if you don't want to do, or going for 1.74, which is quite a lot more expensive than a 1.67. another option is to look at some frames sold elsewhere, perhaps online. you might find some acetate frames with nosepads that might suit you, and specsavers (at least here in the uk) offer a service where you bring in your own frame for them to put new lenses in. hope that helps!",reddit,0,0,0.9998273,0.00017274408

8914,"it's possible you were having issues getting the best prescription because your eyes have been dry. dryness will alter the surface of your eye. this can cause fluctuating astigmatism values or inaccurate measurements from the machines or whoever is doing the refraction (optometrist most likely). regardless of what you choose to do, is recommend treating the dry eye aggressively to see if this helps your overall situation. use an artificial tear 4 times a day in both eyes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). use the drop even if you don't feel you need it. if you use the tears more than 4-6 times a day, switch to a preservative free variety. also, don't use anything with a redness reducer. so avoid visine, clear eyes, ophcon, naphcon, and lumify. i'd suggest a brand like refresh, blink, systane, liquitears, genteal, or theratears. there are a bunch of brands but you can use any, even the cheapest is a good place to start. in addition, do a hot compress once a day for 5 minutes (heat a washcloth under hot water and rest it on the closed eyes). once the 5 minutes are over, take the heat off the eyelids and gently massage the eyelids with your fingers. this will also help improve the quality of your tears. furthermore, if you work on screens often or read a lot or do focused near work (knitting, puzzles, crosswords, painting...), this is contributing to your dry eye surface. follow what's called the 20/20/20 rule. every 20 minutes is focused work/tv/computer..., take a 20 second break where you look up from what you're doing and look 2 feet away. it will help remind you to blink and reduce strain. you should also put an extra eye drop in before doing your focused activity to help keep the surface lubricated. another important thing to know is your age. if you're under 16, your glasses are much more important for the health of your eyes and you need the most accurate prescription. if you're older than that, wearing any glasses won't hurt your eyes. but if you're wearing the wrong prescription, things will be blurry and you're more likely to get eye strain and headaches while using the glasses. just because you are given a prescription for glasses doesn't mean you have to get it. if you're concerned the prescription isn't great, get another opinion and a new refraction (preferably after treating your dry eyes for at least 2-4 weeks). you'll be glad it only cost you a glasses exam fee instead of having to buy two pairs of glasses (which can get quite costly).",reddit,0,0,0.9940088,0.00599127

how could i live the way i would want her to be able to? i don't want to make it sound like it has all been an airy fairy /crystals and incense type experience either though, because there are some grounded practical steps i've taken to handle the stress and fears as well. 1. my rheumatologist put me on plaqunil while i was trying due to the literature showing that it quite possibly cuts the risk of heart block in half. it is my understanding this can be effective if started by 10 weeks. forewarning if you seek to be put on the medicine, you may get some push back because the studies have only been done on mothers that have already had a child with heart block, not first time mothers. my maternal fetal specialist said while they didn't think it was necessary, they considered the medicine safe and would go along with the rheumatologist. being on hcq has given me some added peace of mind. 2. i continued to see a counselor and have been able to talk with her about my fears and the pregnancy process as well as some of the darker feelings of blaming myself etc... this has been very helpful. 3. i enrolled in a research study for anti-ro positive mothers. the primary investigator of the study is one of the top researchers in this area (jill buyon out of nyu langone). the student is called stopbloq [ 1. basically they sent me an at home fetal doppler monitor and provided training videos and sample audio files of normal/abnormal heart rates. i then take a reading 3 times and day and send it over to them. if at any time something sounds out of the norm, i can text an on-call pediatric cardiologist who will review the audio file and let me know if i need to have an emergency echocardiogram. they linked me up with a research site in my state where i can go if necessary. having this added support has been an amazing blessing. 2. in summary, i hear her heartbeat 3 times a day in conjunction with the normal standard of care weekly echocardiograms at my local maternal fetal medicine specialist. hearing it before i go in makes it so much less scary... like ""oh my gosh what are they going to find this week"" type thing. 3. if you are in the usa and less than 18 weeks pregnant you may be able to enroll in the study if you are interested. there are some states without a participating site, but many states have one. 4. i got a better understanding of the reality of heart block. it is common amongst those of us with this autoantibody to know the 2%/16-20% numbers. 2% if you're a first time mom, 16-20% if your a mom who has already had a baby with heart block. but what i wasn't familiar with was... if it happens, then what. well, the fact is more babies with this type of heart block live than die. that is not to discount complications they can have nor the scary reality of the 20-30% who pass away. but it did help me to realize that the worst case scenario for a first time mom was a small percent of the already small percent if that makes sense. i really hope something in the long wall of text has been helpful for you. i know how awful and dark the feelings can be and i hope you can get some relief from them.",reddit,0,1,0.0006785845,0.99932146
9640,"i'll start off by saying that i realize am in a very fortunate position compared to many here. this isn't a post to brag but rather hopefully give some insight to those that may be where i was a few years ago. keratoconus runs in my family (my mom has had a transplant in each eye) so it was always something that i had been terrified of getting. i was always very diligent in bringing it up to my eye doctor any time i had an appt. about 6 years ago, i got the update that i'd need to go see an opthalmologist who specializes in keratoconus. sure enough shortly after, i was diagnosed. the good news was that it was still early. i was still able to see 20/20 with glasses, but i knew it was a race against the clock for me. at the time, the us wasn't fully approved for cxl so i made sure to be even more diligent in getting routine exams until it was. after it became approved in the us, about 3 years ago, i got cxl in my ""bad"" eye and a few months after that got it in my ""good"" eye. now every time i go see the eye doctor, i'm paranoid that my eyes are still progressing and that cxl wasn't effective for me. however, last week during my yearly exam, my eye doctor told me that my prescription and eyes have stabilized and there was very little change from the year before. i was over the moon! not only that, she was now able to fit me with (non-custom) soft contacts for astigmatism!!! (like what people without keratoconus wear!) i almost cried right there in the office. again, i realize that i'm in a very rare position and that seeing 20/20 with glasses let alone wearing soft contacts is out of the question for many. but i just wanted to share this because early detection and treatment was key for me. with keratoconus, it's not a matter of if, but when and how fast your eyes get worse. yes, even possibly in an eye that may be ""good"" right now. if you're on the fence about cxl, and your doctor is advising you to get it, imo it's absolutely worth the pain and frustration for a few months after. (i'm not a doctor so please only follow your doctor's advice.) or if you're nervous you have keratoconus, see a doctor asap. the sooner you do, the better.",reddit,0,0,0.98724085,0.012759225

9674,"this! i was in excruciating pain for years, but too ashamed to go to the dentist. when i finally got up the nerve for a consultation, the tech came in to do a teeth cleaning. i told her i was there for a consultation as my teeth couldn't be saved. i started crying, ashamed. i didn't have my sjogrens diagnosis, but i'm celiac and that can cause teeth damage, too. the dentist came in and was very sweet and understanding. that made all of the difference. she was upset i had waited so long as i had to have been in extreme pain, which i was. we made a plan to pull my remaining top teeth and the molars on my bottom left that were causing great pain. it took me a long time to heal due to autoimmune disorders. finally had to go on steroids. that helped. we didn't have dental insurance, but this office financed in house. they added 10% and we had to put 30% down. we pulled some money out of our 401k to cover half of it. otherwise, i would never have been able to afford it. i didn't get the bottom done while i was there because i was working full time and going to work without teeth was not an option. i couldn't stay home for weeks and weeks. please consider offering in house credit, if you don't already. i've needed to get the bottom done, but am facing the same issue, but with insurance. we moved to a different state and i need to find a new dentist. it's scary. we also took a huge loss in income by moving. i worked for my husband and the owner, husband was vp, understood my health issues and allowed flexibility. my health has gotten worse, as well, and i'm currently appealing a denial for disability. thus, we lost $40k a year. it's a lot harder to come up with the money. we are building our own home, we are living in it, but it's not complete, without financing. my husband is literally doing all the work himself.

9681,"hope i'm not too late to this - i had a reply typed out within half an hour of posting and it just... didn't post? my wifi is terrible, so not surprising. here's what i wrote: another 24 year old year with a large part of her self-identity stemming from her intellectual prowess chiming in here. i've probably had sjogren's since i was 8, and hashimoto's before that. while brain fog hasn't been my *primary* symptom or even my tertiary symptom, it has been the one i have struggled emotionally with more than any other. i'm also working on my phd in physics, and so the brain fog has impacted my work quite substantially. looking back on the tail end of my four-year undergraduate experience, what i now know as the sjogren's brain fog started to kick in. it would manifest in the form of being unable to focus on anything for more than about 5 minutes when previously i could focus on something uninterrupted for 50+min stretches. on brain fog days, i wouldn't be able to retain new information, and any work i did would either be completed agonizingly slowly (like you said, hours for a single page of information), or that work would be riddled with errors. it was incredibly frustrating for those last two years of uni, and especially my last semester when it was most frequent and i had 3 senior projects to complete. it got worse when i started my phd two years ago. everything i learned my last two years of undergrad, including the base physics i need to do any higher-level work, has evacuated my brain because of the brain fog i had during undergrad. even worse, the brain fog days became more frequent, and the brain fog itself became more intense. i ended up having to go on medical leave in november 2019 because the previous 6 months had gotten so bad. i'd been hospitalized for other symptoms off and on in october, and the brain fog rendered me quite literally unable to do any work on my research. the best i can describe it is that my vocabulary almost entirely vanished. i could barely form coherent sentences. i couldn't read, partly because i had double vision constantly, and partly because my brain would get part way through a sentence and then fizzle out so completely that my vision would go entirely white, all my thoughts would completely scatter, and sometimes, in addition to forgetting what the sentence had contained up to that point, i'd forget where i was and my own name. the same ""words go white"" phenomenon, as i was able to succinctly and ineffectually describe it to my doctors, was also prevalent when i was writing, coding, or speaking. this meant i couldn't learn new ideas. i couldn't hold concepts in my head long enough to form connections or generate ideas. i couldn't do anything that would move my phd forward. hell, i couldn't even form thoughts like ""i'm hungry"" or ""my joints are very crunchy and it hurts a lot"" or ""i need to move this spoon to my mouth so i can get enough calories to not die."" it was really bad. while the only way to address my issues this last year was through medication, something that i understand isn't in the cards for you, the meds haven't completely helped the brain fog go away. i'm *still* on medical leave (thanks, covid), but i am trying to do some light work at home, and i've found some ways to get by. like with you, trying a series of strict regimens of diets and supplements did absolutely nothing for me, and exercise only serves as a stress reducer. valuable at times, but not a complete solution. instead, in order to compensate for the sjogren's brain fog, i use skills i learned from the brain fog i've experienced with hashimoto's for the last decade. when i feel the ever-present brain fog increasing in severity, i take a series of steps: 1) i make myself a cup of tea, no matter what i was doing before. i find that the tea and the process of making it helps me calm down emotionally, and as others have stated, your own stress can be your biggest obstacle with the brain fog. while making/drinking it, i prepare for the rest of my day as will be discussed in steps 2 and 3. 2) i think about how i can change my schedule for the rest of the day to be as non-physical as possible. doing lots of physical activity when the brain fog peaks makes me less able to do anything mental, so i try to adjust what my day holds to the best of my control to prioritize the mental tasks. where can i take a bus instead of walking or driving? do i have the budget and supplies to eat pre-prepared meals instead of cooking? can i skip my band or kung fu practice this evening? 3) i think about all the tasks i have for the rest of the day and the rest of the week. is there anything immediately due tomorrow that i have to power through? if so, i move that immediately to the top of my to-do list so i can complete it before the brain fog gets too overwhelming. then, i move anything that requires learning important information or writing papers to the bottom of my list so i can tackle them when the brain fog is less bad. more minor tasks i find i have success in during brain fog are menial and repetitive tasks, like number crunching, replying to daily emails, organizing my workspace and research items, and developing soft skills. 4) once i have a handle on how i can adjust my day, i make another cup of tea and move myself into a workspace that has at least one spot of a completely bare, white wall or ceiling easily visible from where i sit. when the brain fog starts becoming overwhelming and stressful while i work, i stare at that blank spot for a while and do my best to think of nothing because the lack of stimulation it provides clears my head. this makes me less stressed and makes the brain fog temporarily less invasive. some days, staring at that spot 3 minutes out of every hour is enough to stay productive. some days, i have to space out to it for half an hour at a time to accomplish anything. on bad days, sometimes i just lay down on the floor for a bit while i veg to the blank spot on the wall. 5) i keep tea and water readily available throughout the day, as well as small snacks. when the brain fog gets bad, i've found that taking a literal minute to disengage from my work and focus on the act of eating/drinking re-energizes my brain. i've found particular success switching back and forth between green tea, lemon and ginger tea, and hard ginger candies. 6) the second emotions start to come in, the second i start feeling frustrated at my brain instead of the work, i stop. walk away. go to the bathroom. stare at a blank wall in another room. go outside and listen to birds. whatever. just physically remove myself from the frustration until i am calm again. the only way to live and have any form of productivity with constant and persistent brain fog is to not let it rule my life. to live with it as a symbiote because it never really goes away, yes, but to not bow to it. some days are better, some days are worse, and i find doing these things allow me to let my brain rest throughout the day while still feeling as though i'm productive amd proactive. i think it works because these tasks focus on clearing my head to prevent me from wallowing in the stress and depression. with sjogren's, stress is one of the biggest factors in worsening a flare. it can be tough to acknowledge the internal stress brain fog causes, and so incredibly easy to write everything off as ""if only i work harder, i'll be better."" my ability to function increases a thousandfold when i listen to my brain instead of my stress and insecurity. if my brain doesn't want to work, i don't work. i stare at a blank wall or listen to music or go for a walk or make tea, whatever feels right in the moment, and i trust my brain will tell me when it is ready to work again. it never takes my brain as long to rest and recover as the voice of fear in my head screams at me that it will. also, when the resource you depend on more than anything else for your identity and your career fails you continuously, it is hard not to experience depression. like someone said earlier, it's not a depression as we generally think of it per se because you know what's causing it, but the constant undercurrent of fear, not knowing if your brain will fail you so completely that you have to change who you are at your core and so that you'll never be able to do any of your favorite activities again, is harrowing. it's trauma. listen to your body. it knows best. in a way, i'm lucky my brain fog started at 15, because i was able to learn how to listen to my body in order to combat brain fog while in the safety net of easy classes and no bills. it's harder when you're older and there are real-life consequences. also, since you asked if people had success at dealing with brain fog and if there was any hope, let me tell you about my last semester of undergrad. my brain fog and other health issues were so bad i barely left my room, and at one point i had to get dean approval to take two weeks off. the entirety of that two week break, i laid in bed, dozing and staring at a blank wall and thinking of nothing, while star trek talked at me in the background 24/7 and my wonderful, amazing housemates brought me food and water. because i let myself rest, i succeeded in keeping top grades, earning highest honors on my cognitive science undergrad thesis and physics senior research project, getting a paper published on a project unrelated to either major, organizing and running the first ever science conference for undergrads at the united nations after 2 years of work, winning a competition to shadow the uk-nyc consul general and uk ambassador to the un for a few days, and graduating.",reddit,0,1,0.0007807093,0.9992193

i thought asians are more prone to suffer from dry eyes, i once read a statistic report about that. anyway, i'll just cut my crap and share what me (and people i know with similar problems) have already found out. # diagnose ##. self diagnose first of all, you should know the current condition of your eyes. here is a very simple way to diagnose yourself. according to severity of eyes' condition, the symptoms can be categorized into 3 levels: 1. light: you can read real paper book (or newspaper, magazine, anything like that) for as long time as you want. you doesn't feel a thing while reading. but you eyes are feeling difficult while using a mobile phone or work in front of a screen monitor. 2. medium: hours of book reading make your eyes tired. not to mention screen monitors. 3. severe: even openning your eyes is difficult. you want to secrete more tears but no, there is just no tears in eyes, not if you yawn or cry. you especially hate windy weather outside, because it leads to your sore and painful eyes. guys, i'm not here to terrify you, there symptoms are what actually happened between us. and don't be desperate, i'm here to spread my experience. ## hospital diagnose you can also go to hospital, there are a bunch of machines made for this. i guess it won't costs much. in china, it costs roughly 50 dollars (chinese yuan converted to usd). with the help of machines, you'll get a report and some data about your eye condition: 1. how long can your tear film lasts each time you close and reopen your eyes? 2. what is the amount of tear you have in your eyes? 3. did you eye glands that secrete tears shrink or becoming distorted? these information is helpful, at least you need to know what happened to your eyes. sorry for the amateur description, i'm not familiar with medical terms, especially in english. # do's and don'ts ##. what to do? you can of course go to see the doctor, and often times you will have to try many doctors. in china, it seems that there is no mature way to cure dry eyes. what the eye doctor will do is let you try several kinds of eyedrops, and they often don't work well. remember, if you are using any kind of eyedrops, just make sure they are absolutely preservative free. also there are some mini-scale surgeries like smartplug and lipiflow, they are quite more expensive than eyedrops. as far as i know these surgeries are not that helpful, but you can talk with your doctors and know more. i can roughly explain most of methods eye doctors would use, how does it work and why it's not so useful etc. but let's just move on to next paragraph, because i don't really have a positive attitude toward these methods. i don't know if there are different approaches used by doctors in western countries, so don't entirely take my words before ask the doctor for help. the most valuable thing you can do is to limit your screen time. i know there are factors other than screen that cause dry eyes, yes i know, but as long as you already have dry eyes symdrom then quit using screen should improve your condition instantly. the second valuable thing is doing exercises, outdoor exercises are better. the third is sleeping enough. other things like quit masterbating or get some xanthophyll and eat fresh foods might help or might not, i don't know. three things above are proved to work well. ## don't do! 1. don't use any screen or mobile phone in a dark room! 2. don't get stick to the screen while your eyes are already shouting out loud: help! 3. don't use any eyedrops contain preservative! 4. don't try any eye surgeries before fully informed by doctors! # silver bullet is there a silver bullet, like it can cure it all? the answer is yes and no. ## yes, there is a silver bullet here comes the most important part of this post. a simple truth, what harms your eyes is the light source. it's not about the screen per se, it's the light source that lit the screen. so, if you are using kindle to read books, it should be quite comfortable for you eyes. reading e-ink paper without turning on its back light is just as reading real paper. what's the problem with iphones, laptops, screen monitors? it's the led inside the screen that harms our eyes. as far as i know there is only one another type of screen that doesn't have led: rlcd screens. rlcd screens are often used in outdoor advertisement. the problems with e-ink are the low refresh rate and limited color display. e-ink screen is just not acceptable if you are using it to work or do any kind of serious learning. what we have found out is to remove the led inside the screen monitor and use natural light as the light resource to lit the screen. it's not easy to do, but you'll get familiar after you have one or two experience dismantling it. not all screen monitors are good for this, make sure it uses a tn panel, not ips, not va, not oled, it should be tn. tn panel has better transparency. don't be scared, indoor lighting using led won't harm, as long as the light doesn't directly shot into your eyes (like while you're using screens) then it should be fine. ## no, there is no silver bullet after you remove all harmful light source from screens, your eyes should make big improvement. but are they cured? sorry, the answer is a no. for people have level 3 symptoms, you still need to rest your eyes as much as possible. i don't have a strict rule for everyone, just don't overuse it. things like sleeping and doing exercises are big pluses to your eyes, things like overusing your eyes, especially using normal led lit screens are big minuses to your eyes. increase more pluses and decrease more minuses, then you should get through this fucking tricky disease, even without using any drugs or surgeries. if your eyes just feel really dried up, you can use hylo tear drop or use a hot towel to very lightly touch you eyes. --- here we should put a period to this post, i think it's just already so long. i know there are many details i didn't expand into, so if you have any questions please leave comments below, i'll check regularly and see if i can help.",reddit,0,0,0.7772289,0.22277112

12016,"""you must be awful at talking to girls if you look the way you do and are desperate haha"" - i was catching up with an old friend who recently got engaged. he asked me about my girl situation, so i told him that i had a few dates here and there that lead to nothing and haven't really found anything serious. being in my late 20's, all my friends are married or engaged and at this point i've been starting to feel desperate. he then says ""you must be awful at talking to girls if you look the way you do and are desperate haha"", and he's so right it hurts. social anxiety and low confidence is ruining my life, also doesn't help that i'm an introvert. i'm horrible at talking to people, getting to know them, making them feel good, making myself seem interesting, making genuine connections, etc. i basically black out and forget to do/say even the most basic things like introducing myself. i live in the heart of a city, in college, consistently flooded with tinder/bumble/okcupid matches, always complimented on my looks, and surrounded by people everywhere i go like on the subway, on campus, and the office, so knowing what my life could be like bums me out because i'm just wasting all this opportunity. you'd think with all those things on my side i'd have no problem, but the problem is me. i'm afraid to initiate conversations in person, and the rare times i do it pretty much bombs and gets awkward pretty quickly. i just feel so ""alone in a crowded room"" all the time. how can i get out of this rut and thrive in social situations? it's not even just people i'm attracted too, it's pretty much anyone, any age, any gender. i think it's talking to someone, one on one, that's the worst for me because i have to be 100% engaged and the spotlight is on me which makes me uncomfortable. i do a little better in small groups of 3-4 people because there's less pressure on me to keep things moving. what can i do to build confidence and not panic when speaking with someone? i know it takes practice, but i need more advice than ""just go out and talk to people!""",reddit,0,0,0.92481345,0.07518659

12144,"crippling anxiety around girls. - im a 14 (male) and i have some really bad anxiety when it comes to talking to girls. background ------------------------------------------------------------------- i have recently started to notice how anti-social i am with girls, i have never had any kind of problem when talking to my male friends, but i have never really had any female friends since my shcool is basically separated by genders, we go to the same school and everything, but we never got to talk to the girls (at least in school),the only time we acctually get to see each other in school is when we're going home, and the teachers will always tell you to go to your different dispatch areas if you're talking to the girls. basically, since i have been in this school all the way since preschool i never got to really know girls, and honestly i didn't care until recently, when we started to go to parties and stuff like that. (i didn't really take much priority over my social life when i was little, i just didn't care. and now i tend to more care on my studies than actually beign social). i remember that whenever i try to talk to girls i just tend to feel akward, out of place, like i dont know what im doing there or what to say. it feels like im just standing there creeply watching everybody talk while i just stand there without saying a word.(because they're normaly talking about stuff wich i'm not really interested in, so i really cant relate to what they are saying.) so i just slowly back up before i even say a word or just i dont even attempt to talk to them, i know it sounds stupid but i just can't bring myself to talk to them, even if some of my friends are there i just feel out of place, almost as if they're speaking antother language. beign an introvert i have very few close friends which enjoy the same hobbies as i do (drawing,memes, and other dumb stuff) so i dont normally learn about new stuff, and i tend to just try to ignore some of the ""highschool drama"" (that will often be what they will be talking about). the only one time that i can acctually remember talking to a girl about something and feeling comftable was when i went to an academic tournament, for once i had something to talk about, something to have in common. she gave me her snapchat, (something which i rarely us, but i appreciated the gesture) i thought i would have a female friend, but as the tournament had ended i just got kind of disconnected, i didnt have anything else to talk about,i tought it would feel odd to talk to her about something else, like she would see me as some kid of creep. i still wanted her to be in touch but once again i just got lost. lastly i would like to say that i tend to overthink things, like when i think about gathering up the courage to talk to a girl, ""will she see me as some kind of creep?"", ""will i look akward?"", "" what does she think of me?"", so many questions that by the time im done thinking either i just decide to not go, or the oportunity has flown out of my grasp. thanks i really needed to get this off my chest, sorry for the nasty mess of a post.",reddit,1,1,0.00023718257,0.99976283

(she convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. which, it was, but not all like she thought. this was also good advice from her point of view because i had a lot in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. so leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) i was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me i stop loving her. she deserved someone better, so i made that choice for her. i wanted to be better. i wanted to be someone she deserved. so i started trying to be a person. i went and got a real hairstyle (i use to just use clippers and do it myself.) i started running/biking again. (i have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) i got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. i went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and i just wore running/work out attire. i enrolled in school, which is something i stopped when i went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. in school i started strong, i was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so i could get connections for an internship. then my anxiety hit me, hard. i couldn't finish my resume because i am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. i lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. that caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. my 4 a's fell to near f's and i was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate i knew from an old job and rounded my grades to c's before the end. even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. nothing changed. no one cared. i ended things last november with her. i was motivated to better myself until april. i went to the gym every other day, i ate healthy, i wasn't excited to be back in school, but i did it and took pride in doing so. but the pride in myself diminished to nothing. i still had no one to go have fun with. no one texted how i was doing. i even stopped getting likes/conversations on tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. i am lonelier more than ever, and i have been without close people most of my life. i use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. or teach people english (which is something that brought me joy.) now the only connection i feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes i get on something. i use to be a lurker and only send messages when i saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. i would just tell them i would be here to listen for the former case and that i appreciate them if it were the latter. i use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. it is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. since april i have basically laid in bed. i still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. i browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. i don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy i am. i don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if i am really fooling people. i don't want to be a burden so i don't talk about anything. when my brother's girlfriend asked why i wasn't leaving for classes i told her i missed the deadline to enroll because i was depressed a friend of mine passed away. really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. i would have loved to be friends with her. she was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. i was especially torn up about losing someone that i use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. she was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, i wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. why couldn't the world have taken me instead? i can't find any strength in myself. i don't know what to do.",reddit,1,0,0.9867365,0.013263543

12862,"im terrified (please give me advice or success stories) - hey all, so im 18 and am a senior in high school. for my whole life ive dealt with social anxiety disorder as well as generalized anxiety disorder. these affect my daily life pretty badly but im usually able to keep my head above water and get through the school day despite being completely exhausted. i go to a small private school and luckily have been able to take advantage of some of their mental health outlets (such as a calming room, in school therapist appointments,etc.). although these things exist for me and i have a few places to go if im really struggling, ive been petrified of going to school. today was the first day back from winter break and i couldnt even muster up the courage to go. i was so stressed out that i didnt sleep at all last night. the reasons ive been terrified to go to are as follows: 1. before winter break i had an important presentation that went terribly. i stuttered, shook, and could not get through the presentation very well. this set off a string of anxiety and panic attacks the rest of the day. because i was struggling so bad i went to the calming room, but as soon as i stepped out of the room an hour later, i had more panic attacks. it got so bad i thought i was going to pass out so i ended up running into the nearest classroom to ask for help. the crowded hallways affected me so severely. 2. following this, during winter break i could not even go into a store. i love shopping, but i couldnt step foot in a store without having a panic attack. how was i supposed to spend 8 hours at school when i couldnt even spend 20 minutes in a store? 3. my panic attacks make me feel like im dying or having a medical emergency and i dont feel comfortable at school 4. ive lost all motivation and cant even focus on work. i failed two of my exams because i was so anxious i couldnt understand what the questions were asking i couldnt sleep last night because i was pondering on these things. i dont take any meds (which may change soon) and my counselor is planning to meet with me when i return to school to create a plan to help me feel more comfortable at school. im very frustrated because i feel pathetic and weak. its hard for me to talk about this with people im close with, such as my long term boyfriend and best friend because theyre extroverted and confident in social situations. they dont really understand, though they try to, but i just feel as if i come across as stupid. this is severely affecting my life and i feel trapped, even to the point where i wish i could just disappear. i just want the old me back. even though im usually anxious 24/7, i miss when i could go to school without having a panic attack. my physical symptoms are the worst thing and they make me panic more, them being: - shaking and feeling weak -dissociation -dizziness and faintness - stomach ache or ibs - strongggg fatigue - confusion or lack of focus - shortness of breath - heart palpitations please give me any tips you have that you think would help me. how did you get your life back when struggling with social anxiety?",reddit,1,1,0.0002765178,0.9997235

12884,"man, i was right where you were. i know exactly almost how you feel. i know when your in the mindset outside advice is hard to take. i have felt like i'm drowning in a black abyss and nobody around me seems to notice. i have felt so alone lost in my own head and easily became depressed about life and having no direction. so i know this advice may not take easily, but just know it comes from someone who's been in that exact spot. you gotta focus on something to get your life moving forward. for me grades and school work i always used as something to put energy in. cause i had a tiny tiny tiny hope to cling to that i could go to college and become better and make money and pull myself out of bad situations. and now i'm 24 and did all the things i pushed myself to do. you gotta change how you think about stuff. you don't have to super social to be happy. you don't have to make a lot of friends in college to be happy. there is nothing wrong/bad/incorrect with being solo. start thinking about these things and try and find a life goal to work towards. find that tiny tiny tiny bit of hope. and this sounds like bullshit, but with time you won't be in the same life situation anymore. things change ( sometimes slowly), but i'm nothing like i was at 17. you will change. for the better. depression and anxiety are still with me but you develop skills and they don't affect me as much or in the same ways. so please don't hurt yourself. i had those thoughts before. just know time moves life forward and if you put in some work now you can plan and make a better life for yourself. one with things you actually want in it.",reddit,1,1,0.00054699235,0.999453
12894,"voice problems - for a long time i've had problems with my voice. when i talk to people my voice feels muffled, low, and like it doesn't project well. it also cracks pretty frequently, even though i'm 20 years old. people often can't understand me and ask me to repeat myself. i notice that my throat feels restricted and sore after even a little bit of talking. i think this problem originated back in middle school. for whatever reason, i was insecure about my voice, so i think i lowered it intentionally. now, however, it seems like the pitch of my voice is not within my control, but that may be because i'm so incredibly resistant to talking in my normal voice that it just seems that way. this is incredibly frustrating, stressful, and burdensome, and makes me want to try to get better at socializing even less. i've had this problem for a long time now and don't know what to do to make things better. does anyone experience something similar with their voice? i'm considering taking singing lessons or going to a speech therapist in the hope that it might help.",reddit,1,1,0.00029238468,0.99970764

12984,"i was always shy as a kid, got bullied and was too afraid to say anything so it continued, then i developed low self esteem and learned to keep my feelings inside, which i still do today. i also had a lot of negative experiences, so rather than making a fool of myself or not wanting to look stupid or feel humiliated (because it happened before), this led to avoiding, which (of course) makes things worse. my parents didn't originally know how to ""parent,"" children's aid used to come to our home. but after that, my parents became overly protective. i only learned how to tie my shoes a few years ago (i am 16..) and by myself, and i don't have to do anything in my life because my mother does all of it, which i already know will impact me in future (encourages my avoidance and not knowing how to be independent). i bring up the topic of social anxiety sometimes, and they get the idea that i am asocial (as an extreme introvert) but won't accept that i am socially anxious. they say i am over exaggerating, others have it worse, we all experience anxiety, things like that.. so even as a kid, i never had anyone to go to about my feelings or problems. i don't allow myself to cry at home because they'd say i have no reason to, and i don't want my siblings seeing how ""weak"" i am, especially since i get random urges to cry and often not able to explain why. since i was 7 years old i've used the computer for gaming for hours everyday, which may have impacted me socially?",reddit,1,1,0.00024076221,0.99975926

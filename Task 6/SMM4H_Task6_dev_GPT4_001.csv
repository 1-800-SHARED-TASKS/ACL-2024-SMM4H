8804,"Dear doctor of optometrists of the internet I am asking advice based on multiple different opinions. Firstly I have two optometrists due to one having all my history and one recently that performs a more comprehensive exam. The one with my history told me I'd be more eligible and satisfied with icl, whereas my new optometrist said lasik. Me being a worrier and avid researcher when making decisions went in for multiple consults. I had 3 lasik places that gave me the label of B- on candidacy and 1 that told me I was too borderline for it. They told me it was one and done procedure due to my high myopia. I'm 28 going on 29 Male My script is L -8.75 sph -1.25 cyl Axis 180 R -7.25 sph -2.00 cyl axis 180. My K value was 46 for both eyes where they said I'd be 38 post op. Corneal thickness was 556 preop with 320 on my left and high 330s for my right. They set a treatment optic zone of 6.0. With lasik my concerns would be dry eye, ectasia, and night glare that may not be treatable and also outcomes you guys have seen with patients with high myopia treated with lasik because I'm hoping you guys have insight. ICL was recommended due to its reversibility and less complications of dry eye and night vision problems also possibility of enhancement. My concern with icl is glaucoma. My great grandmother on of my dads mom and my moms dad had it. My eye pressure is around 19-20 mmHg. I have been told by all refractive surgery centers I'm in a unique position as I am a decent candidate for all. But lasik or prk would be a one time treatment. And I've been told to not due prk due to haze. In terms of stabilization I was a -7.5 L and -6.5 right at 18. With same astigmatism. At 27 I got -8.0 L and - 7.0 R. After not wearing contacts for examination I got the new script which was apparently due to my cornea going back to normal shape. I use to wear toric soft lenses. Also I had lattice degeneration that was treated with laser by my retina specialist he said no other complications exist in terms of macula or optic nerve. I guess I'm kind of lost on the decision to make and wondering what professionals have seen with high myopic patients in terms of refractive surgery. ",reddit,1,1

8807,"Hello, I've been briefly scanning this thread and I was hoping to have some answers from those directly affected by Sjogrens Syndrome... This will be sort of long in explanation but I'm generally discomforted and concerned. To begin, I'm 18/F. Auto Immune disorders like Lupus and RA have been running in my family for some time and I've been experiencing symptoms that a doctor had suggested could be caused by Sjogrens. This is a severe diagnosis and my family members with Lupus explained it's taken them years to be officially diagnosed and that I should be concerned and get into contact with a rheumatologist. I wondered if it was worth it for my symptoms and if diagnosis was equally hard with Sjogrens like Lupus or if it's a true negative no matter what ? What finally lead to an official diagnosis for you all and what qualifies as enough in your opinion to seek a specialist? I experience the sensation of dry nose, throat mouth and eyes (occasionally itchiness of my eyes) causing my head to hurt, I'll randomly become dizzy and pressure will accumulate around my face. It's at its worst when I wake up and when Im trying to sleep, however still very prominent throughout my day and noticeable. The best way I could describe it, is that it burns to breathe through my nose like things are too cold or not wet enough and it makes a dry, painful sensation in my throat despite posnasal drip. It irritates my mouth and eyes, feeling like I woke up with Cotton Mouth or I'm hung over. I struggle swallowing, making it hard to sleep as I constantly feel like there's a lump in my throat, I feel like I'm choking when my nose suddenly is dry and no longer ""clear""<U+009D>. It'll occasionally hurt to talk too long and I constantly have a dry cough because I'm always trying to subconsciously fix it. It's like feeling winded and having a dry spot in your throat from not swallowing enough so you constantly do it to fix it. It also makes me feel as though I swallow food down the wrong tube. I was only prompted with this diagnosis after being irritated enough to think I had Strep Throat and further explaining my symptoms. The test came back negative. On and off for the last year or two, I've exhibited these symptoms accompanied by weird facial burning like a sunburn sensation, excessive heartburn, occasional dizziness and aching of places where I've had broken bones prior or my joints, most generally being in my arms and legs. It has brief periods where it's barely noticeable and it's not a raging irritation. It's not that it hurts painfully bad usually, but rather its very mild and seems never ending enough for me to despise it and not ignore it. I was tested for Lupus, Sjogrens and RA all of which came back negative so my doctors are trying to move on (which is great if there's an actual solution) but I know how long it took my relatives to officially be diagnosed or finally dismissed. However, I'm still so uncomfortable and now my doctors seem to be testing me for things that don't exactly make sense as a whole like Influenza or Lyme. They've also attributed my symptoms to be caused by anxiety and stress as I have a lot going on however, if anyone in this thread knows what anxiety dryness, numbness/weakness or throat irritation is like, you'll too, know that it's not the same as what I'm describing- it being that it's not a response to adrenaline or worrying. What I experience is rather constant. (As for the lab tests, I'll have the results Monday the 13th) My symptoms fluctuate in intensity and lately my body is becoming less dry as I think it's overcoming the intensity from this ""flare""<U+009D> as my aunt with Lupus suggests. I still have the sensation of dryness 2/3 times but there's clearly moisture in at least my mouth right now. Like my mouth for example, it's usually extremely dry due to my nose being dry and it leads to dry eye and pain in my face. Now it seems to be less intense. (I don't know if that's from the help of biotene or eye drops however). It was a strong few months of it climaxing to its worst and my symptoms by no means have completely subsided. I recognize what I'm feeling from this time last year and from when i suspect that it's began as a whole, the end of summer both years in a row, now. I do have seasonal allergies but they present with congestion, pressure in different places... so I've ruled that out. Also is it normal to have dry crusty sensation in the nose and eyes even with some moisture being present? Sounds silly, I know... and does anyone find that the more water they drink the headache increases or that spit becomes more thick and harder to swallow?.. Ive tried sinus meds, eye drops that sometimes burn but usually feel so relieving ( meant for moisture) saline spray which dries me out and burns- I now use something specifically for moisture but I feel like it just drops to my throat and irritates, I've tried cold and flu meds... I constantly moisturize as I've struggled with dry skin since I was a little girl and still my skin gets patchy or my lips will peel and crack ( I use chapsticks and scrubs like it's my job! It makes no sense)... I drink upwards of two gallons of water trying to remain comfortable, using biotene sprays and eye drops and coconut oil for moisture. I take ibuprofen for pain and use heating pads for pain as well. A Humidifier is present and I try to keep room on the colder side. I have central air heating. Hydration is very important to me as it's been an irritant in my life for a long time, suddenly it doesn't seem as effective as normal. I do not drink coffee and I've cut out smoking or vaping for 4-5 months now. I was hoping to see if my symptoms are still valid of Sjogrens or if maybe there's hope for something else less serious that I could bring up in an appointment for those of you who had their Sjogrens misdiagnosed originally? Maybe I'm experiencing symptoms of something else. More blatantly said, I'm not looking for a diagnosis but, rather, I'm trying to become more educated on the topic as I'm losing sleep from the irritation, constant urination and am generally very discomforted all day. Online research is hard and cryptic in my opinion, as well as not always accurate. I figured asking real people would be more beneficial. I'm open to any and all suggestions if you've read this far. The best to you all who struggle with an Auto Immune issue especially Sjogrens. Thanks again!! Please ask any questions you may need for a better understanding, I'm very desperate as health issues spark my anxiousness and work me up lol I'm sorry if I sound dumb or should be asking in a different subreddit.

8809,"I got diagnosed 10 yrs ago as a teen, have been through nearly everything. I second diet and supplement treatment, as I tried plaquenil and had more negatives than positive. I've come to terms that my Sjogren's isn't going away, but if I can prolong the best of my health then I will. With plaquenil, I was cranky/snippy all the time, more sensitive to sunlight (became practically a hermit), and severe tummy issues. I had less joint pain, but that was about it. I've found the right supplement mix with the help of a naturopath, and sticking to a balanced diet has allowed for long-term steady health. I found the Mediterranean diet was best for me (though I skip the wine part); I stay away from inflammatory foods like red meat, rather sticking to anti-inflammatory stuff like garlic, turmeric, etc. I really like fish for the omega-3s. And I drink a shitton of water too. Obviously, I'm not a doctor, so check in with a doctor first if you can. Also, I do have a pre-hypothyroidism situation going on, and it seems that the neck lumps is a concern of yours based on other comments. I take a supplement to pull back on that and get my thyroid back to normal, and that has helped my jawline come back a bit. I'd advise asking a doctor to check on other autoimmune or thyroid issues as well, as where there's one autoimmune issue, there's more stuff going on. Lastly, I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but acupuncture has helped me the most with gland reduction and proper salivation, to a point my dentist pointed it out at my regular checkup after starting acu treatments. My chronic pain has also definitely gone way down. I'm very lucky in that my insurance covers it, and it's definitely not for everyone, just my experience. Everybody's bodies are different, and a lot of folks with autoimmune issues tend to have a fun lil cocktail of stuff going on. Find a doctor you trust who's willing to figure out your situation and determine the best fit for your needs. If you're interested in more natural remedies, I recommend a naturopath. If you prefer Western medicine and get more benefits from plaquenil, a primary care doc and *especially* a rheumatologist are your best bet. ",reddit,0,0
8810,Ok so I came back from the retina specialist today. He diagnosed me with a mild hyphema and I am treating it as we speak. I'm not nervous about the hyphema but about the possibility of getting glaucoma. I am only 15 and I never had any eye problems. I was hit with a ball. I heard if pressure is built up for a while it can cause glaucoma. My vision actually came back a few hours after trauma but when I was trying to go to bed I think the hyphema bled again. My vision was blurry again. It was already midnight so I just slept on it. When I woke up it was still blurry so I immediately went to the eye doc in the morning. He said my eye pressure was super high and gave me eye drops to bring it down. Today I went to the retina specialist and he said I had no viewable retina damage. (Took an ultrasound) and also didn't think there was any optic nerve damage. My peripheral vision is not black or cut off I still have my full field of vision but everything is blurry. The blurriness has gotten a little better. Which the doc said is the blood from hyphema but I just wanna ask you guys if it could possibly be glaucoma and if I should ask. ,reddit,1,1
8811,"Your need for glasses is determined by your genetic heritage and epigenetic stressors in your environment. Meaning, that what physical traits you inherit can influence how your eye develops. Also, how much time you spend outdoors, how long you read, and how close you hold the material to your eyes can all have an influence on the development of your vision. Even such things as allergies, and eye rubbing could cause deterioration in vision over time (keratoconus is one example). These are just some of the epigenetic factors that can influence vision development. Most eye doctors don't prescribe glasses to people who don't need them. Unfortunately, there's always a few bad apples in every profession; if you're the victim of one, you have my sympathies. In spite of that, I doubt your glasses had anything to do with you developing worsening vision over the last 10 years.

8840,Hi. I developed a 1mm peripheral corneal ulcer on Friday morning from accidentally sleeping in my contacts one night. I have now been on two forms of antibiotics since then and today the doctor told me to start steroid drops to reduce the scar and mild corneal inflammation.

I myself was overminused once, so that's why I think you've gone 'down' a half dioptre in the sphere. Of course it's something to avoid because it can give you headaches and feeling like you're straining but it does happen Your astigmatism correction hasn't increased a wide amount at all, it seems quite regular to me.

I've dispensed glasses for patients whose prescriptions are still changing in their early 30s and aren't presbyopic or having any pathology. So it is variable so referencing your title - nope your Rx change isn't too big for your age. Good luck with dental school and look into contacts if you haven't already, your specs must be quite thick at the edges. Although when you write about the original values having a BC of 4, BC means base curve to me which is a value I associate with contacts? But I'm Australian and our base curves are like 8.4 and 8.6 which is lots larger than 4 lol. maybe different unit of measurement. ",reddit,1,1

8843,"Hi there :) I'm really sorry you are going through this, but you are going in the right direction. To realise that something is wrong is the most important part of the journey. Now you just need to find the right rheumatologist. I'm saying ""right"" because not every doctor will be convinced that you need help, especially if your tests are negative I was diagnosed about a year ago. I'm 33 now. Before that it was a never ending battle between me and the doctors. All my tests were negative so I was ""totally fine"". The only thing that convinced my rheumatologist that i do have sjogren's was my lip biopsy. It proved it. So I think you should start with that. Lip biopsy can't be wrong. If you have sjogren's even in it's beginning stage, it will show it. I was just like you once. Living with all my issues thinking that it's ""normal "". It's not normal. Life is so much better when you know how to manage your illness. Now I fight fiercely for my health and no doctor can tell me that I'm imagining things. As for plaquenil, I started taking it as soon as I got diagnosed. I'm also taking prednisolone and naproxen for pain management. I don't know what other symptoms you have so you decide if you need medications or not. I have severe joint pain and fatigue, so these medications really help. Also these medications stop the progression of the disease. If the disease doesn't progress you don't develop lymphoma. Or at least that's what I was told. Honestly, I don't see any harm in taking plaquenil, but prednisolone is pure evel. Horrible side effects. Doesn't worth it. Vitamins, omega 3, good diet and exercise are the best way to start. If you don't have worse symptoms than your dryness then maybe you don't need to start plaquenil right away. First you have to find a good rheumatologist and do that lip biopsy. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Best of luck to you and stay healthy. ",reddit,1,1

It has been almost a year since I had my surgery for my retinal detachment and I have slowly gained enough courage to try to go for my license (kinda weird I didn't go for it when I was younger I know). I mentioned to my doctor that I was interested in getting my drivers license and would it be safe since I don't want to put myself or others at any risk due to my eye. He said I could but I have to make sure that he fills out a form with the dmv for the vision test. I've been checking the dmv guidelines for the vision screening and I'm wondering is it possible to get the form right off the bat since I know I will likely fail the vision test and be told to get my eyesight checked? How did you fare through this whole ordeal? I know that guidelines are different state to state but regardless I'd like to know what steps you took (for those of you who have retinal detachment) or advice you gave to someone with retinal detachment when they went to go for their drivers license or renewal (for those of you who are doctors)?

8851,"Here is my story. Extremely farsighted as a kid (early 60's) and in glasses. Diagnosed with KC in 1968 and 1970, age 14 and 16. Eye check at school sent me to an optometrist who sent me to an ophthalmologist. All they had back then was RGP lenses. No such thing as CXL or Sclearals. Graduated high school, college and got half a masters degree with RGP's. Had cornea transplants in 1980 and 1982. Cataract surgery 1998 and 1999. One was not successful. The lens implant came out of the capsule and was floating on my retina. I then had a vitrectomy to remove the lens and put another one in. This surgery caused Strabismus and over the period of a year had 4 Occlunum injections into the eye muscle. After all of this, my corneal grafts made it through just fine. I have been in glasses ever since. I retired from my occupation in 2012 and am living a normal life. All I have to do is put my glasses on just like a normal person Saw my doctor on the 13th. My 38 and 40 year old grafts are still clear healthy and I am seeing 20/25 and20/40 in glasses. Next dr apt scheduled in a year. No, my case is not usual and grafts this old are NOT normal.

8852,"I've had a consistent prescription for about 20 years and have excellent vision (corrected). My previous glasses have started to fall apart, so I went to a highly recommended optometrist (i.e. not a discount shop or a Costco/Walmart) to get new glasses. My exam showed that my previous prescription is fine. My prescription is -3.75, -3.50 spherical (no cylinders, no progressives, etc). Upon receiving my new glasses, I noted a vertical line of distortion approx 5-10<U+00B0> off my visual center, away from the center of my face in both lenses - the right being more noticeable. This vertical line causes images to blur, but as I turn past it the image returns to the same level of sharpness as my visual center. Eventually, the image blurs as expected heading toward the edge of the lens. My guess would be that the index of refraction is slightly different here - a degree or two wide. When marking this effect on my lens, it is about 1 cm out from my optical center (i.e. not an edge distortion). The effect is less noticeable up close (like reading a book), but very noticeable driving or looking at fine detail beyond about 10 ft or so (e.g. tv screen across room, map on wall). Additionally, my right eye is slightly blurry, mostly in distance vision (beyond the \~10 ft range). When looking anywhere but up close, its causes my vision to be distracting - like I need to rub my eye and clear it up. As expected, when using only my right eye the blurriness is much more noticeable than when combined, but still aggravating when using both eyes. Oddly, I inadvertently noticed while rubbing my eye, that when my glasses slide up so the nose piece rested on top of my nose, my vision becomes sharp in both eyes. Marking on the lens, this is about 2 cm out and 2 cm down from optical center. I don't know if that matters, but I figured I'd mention it as my my vision is great in that position, but it obviously looks ridiculous. I've returned to the opticians multiple times. They remanufactured the lenses thinking there was some sort of defect multiple times. I did note a slight improvement on the left side, but its really hard to compare as each remake has been about a month apart. I'd had to argue with them a bit to explain that I wasn't talking about edge distortion and get them to actually listen to what I described. I've also been told it is because my lenses are wider, so I am looking through more material when I look off axis. I find that unlikely at 5-10<U+00B0> off axis, plus it clears up after a narrow distortion. The next to last time I went in, they asked me to go more than a couple days and try a full two weeks as my eyes needed more time to adjust (I've never taken more than a day or so to adjust in the past, but I'm getting older, so maybe). They have checked the as-made prescription, my old glasses (prescription matches), and reverified my measurements against the as-built. On my final visit (after a full two weeks of dealing with this annoying blurriness), I went in to the doctor instead of the optician. She verified my prescription and suggested that maybe the coating is causing an issue or a material change could be causing the difference. I brought my old glasses back in and they saw that they were polycarbonate (my new lenses are Trivex). The optician told me that I just need to wait longer to adjust. I'm at 2.5 weeks of wearing them all the time. I feel like the office has just written me off - they already lost money on remaking the lenses a couple times. I don't know what to do. If it was just the vertical distortion, I could probably learn to try and ignore it. I feel like my options are: 1) Accept them as is and hope more weeks of waiting pay off 2) Return them and go back to old glasses until the fully disintegrate 3) Take current glasses to another optometrist and see if they have a better solution/idea of what is happening 4) Return the glasses, go somewhere else, hope that I don't have the same issue I've been wearing glasses for some 30 years now and the only thing I've had like this was a prescription made wrong in one eye which was quickly corrected and worked great.

8858,"Hi, all. I am looking for advice on what specifically to request in my glasses lenses from the optician at my eye doctor's office (independent practice, not a chain or online) and advice on the frame itself. If it matters, I have worn contacts for the last 25+ years and will be getting an updated prescription on those as well. My glasses prescription is around a -13.00 in both eyes. I'm nearing 40 and my prescription is stable, so I'm willing to pay more for thinner lenses, but aside from requesting the high index 1.74, I have no idea what other things to mention or ask of the optician. I have looked online quite a bit, but have become overwhelmed and confused with all the terminology and contradicting articles. Regarding the frame itself, I am currently wearing a frame size 49-17-135. The lens height is around 28. My face is a bit round, so to offset that I have chosen a rectangular shape frame in the past, but realize now this is contributing to the thickness of my lenses. Also, when I smile, my cheeks tend to touch (due to roundness) the bottom of frames with a taller lens height, which the shorter lens of the rectangular frame also prevents. If I were to opt for an oval lens, would the lenses be substantially thicker than if I were to get a round lens? Any advice or insight you could provide so that I may be better informed prior to my appointment would be very helpful. I will certainly be asking for the opinion of the optician, but, while I have great faith in my opthalmologist, I'm not as confident in the optician's knowledge or desire to help. Thank you!

My main question is - If my glasses don't do anything to fix my right eye's vision, even though my optometrist prescribed them with ""astigmatism"" in mind, is that a sign that I should be concerned about an underlying problem which is NOT astigmatism?

I've used glasses all my life (I'm 38), so I went to get some new ones, but that same day I noticed something: my vision wasn't really blurry, it was impaired because I'm seeing a circle shaped layer in the middle of my left eye's field of vision. Kind of feels like a shadow of my pupil was projected from the back. Not saying it's my pupil, but the scale of the circle reminds of it. I made an image: [\[eye. png\](](https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg/aa68a430)[https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg](https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg)[)](https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg/aa68a430) The circle doesn't hide the image, but it feels like a layer of Photoshop with opacity turned slightly up, so the brightness on my left eye is lower. Can't really tell if my entire field of vision is less bright, but for sure within the radius of that circle. I don't really notice the shape until trying to look at it, but the lack of brightness is 24/7. If I cover my right eye and blink my left one quickly, I can see the circle perfectly, but kind of like when you look at a light for some time and you still see it afterwards.. Just like that, but then it fades way while my eye is completely shut. I feel this either started happening recently, or I just noticed the circle. I'm guessing my brain is trying to focus on that circle and real world objects, so it's difficult reading or writing. Not impossible, I'm doing it right now... By the way, I also see floaters, for months. First on my right eye which is okay, I've learned to live with them, then a few of them on my left eye. Also lived with them. But this circle.

KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today.

8877,"Doctors don't take a PD as part of a standard exam because it has nothing to do with your health or prescription. Opticians take a PD measurement when preparing to dispense glasses, if you've bought glasses from your previous optician they will have a record of everything about those glasses in your medical chart for 7 to 30 years by law in most states and provinces in North America and the UK. If you didn't buy glasses from that optician, they wouldn't record any measurements they had taken and given to you on a piece of paper. The reason that we don't hand out PDs is because when people use them to buy glasses online and the glasses end up being garbage quality, the first thing Zenni/etc does is tell them their PD was measured incorrectly (it wasn't), which sends hundreds of people a year back to us to do free customer service and troubleshooting for their shitty companies. The first few times, it's a fun learning experience for staff who are in school. The next few hundred, we get a little jaded about it. ",reddit,0,0

It is mainly when looking at lights or screens or reading things up close. It also varies constantly throughout the day and is definitely happening much more than when it first started. I have tried several fresnel prisms with limited success due to the variable nature of the double vision. I am currently using a 5 diopter prism at a slight angle to try and correct it. It works some of the time but not for all of the day. Basically I've run out of options. My squint is so small I cannot have surgery, prisms are not working all the time but stronger prisms make me feel ill and over correct when looking at distance.

I currently wear scleral lens contacts (the brand is zenlens) and they are comfortable enough to wear all day. My right eye, which is the one with the more advanced keratoconus, is 20/200.

8889,"I work at specsavers (lab tech). I can't say much about the probable lens thickness, as in order to calculate it I'd need the PDs from your prescription. Then I could know the approximate thickness at the edges. The dispensing optician should have taken these measurements, and if you ever want to find out you can call them and ask for it, they are required by law to provide you this information per request in the EU. I have trouble understanding how such thin metal glasses would actually help with the lenses not appearing thick To answer your question here, a thicker plastic frame could potentially mask the lens thickness, but the actual lens inside would still be just as thick. But the second frame you got recommended will actually have thinner lenses despite also being a thin metal rim frame. Let me explain: lenses for myopic (shortsighted) people are thinnest at the centre, and as you go outwards toward the edges, they get thicker. [This image](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00394cfa19142757fad61c60373b9800) illustrates what I mean quite well. By suggesting a smaller diameter frame (which the second one is), you basically guarantee that the lenses will be cut out into a smaller shape, meaning thinner at the edges. So yes, the second frame is a much better choice for you. To sum up, there isn't a lot you can do besides going for an even smaller frame, which I undestand if you don't want to do, or going for 1.74, which is quite a lot more expensive than a 1.67. Another option is to look at some frames sold elsewhere, perhaps online. You might find some acetate frames with nosepads that might suit you, and Specsavers (at least here in the UK) offer a service where you bring in your own frame for them to put new lenses in. Hope that helps! ",reddit,0,0
8890,"So here's the basic story: I'm 31M, have KC. Have been feeling very anxious lately about losing my sight, tbh. My left eye has KC but with glasses it is fine. I get close enough to 20/20, and I only notice minor weird things like higher-order aberrations in my left eye. My right eye is totally useless. I've tried every kind of lens, including RGPs and sclerals. I have one main question: now that I pretty much depend on my left eye to do my job, and since I haven't seen any progression in it, is it advisable to get CXL? My doctor said that it was my choice, that it could progress rapidly, or it could just stay like this forever, but that it was hard to say. My big worry is that my right eye is not corrected well. I've tried a lot of combinations of lenses in that eye, but no matter what, the astigmatism is just too intense to really use it. I've tried SynergEyes, soft lenses, RGPs, and one kind of advanced lens design. I feel bad, because a lot of quite-good lens fitters have fitted the eye and the best I can get is ""good enough"" vision in full light (still lots of HOAs). One of my fitters said there might be an underlying lens problem in my right eye and that I may never be able to expect truly ""good"" vision from the eye. So in light of this, I have a few questions: * My left eye isn't noticably progressing. The amount of HO loss in that eye is fairly minimal, and regular astigmatism is correctable with just glasses. Is it possible that CXL will induce astigmatism that can't be corrected with glasses? What are the rough chances that that will end up happening? * Glasses leave right eye uncorrected, but it can't really be truly corrected with sclerals/GPs either. As in, I can't use a computer monitor with my right eye even with a variety of lenses. * Is it worth considering intacs in the right eye? PRK? The is basically useless at this point.. I realize you all likely can't give a solid answer, but would be happy for any insight I can get. ",reddit,1,1

I've had keratoconus for over 20 years, and if I was to even attempt to drive at night, it would be dangerous not just for me, but anyone else and objects around. I just try to live life without driving at night (or day now). [example of what I see at night](https://twitter.com/marshallholland/status/1446330518241378304?s=21) For me, it's not about confidence or learning how to get around it, it's the inability to see well, period, and finding ways to work around is challenging. My life has been driven by my keratoconus (I just had to accept that), and I have to make choices that accommodate my vision as best as I can. When I was younger, people would pressure me into things, like driving, and they didn't understand my eye disease, they were trying to help, I'm sure, but they couldn't grasp the fact that it's just that my vision is poor and no ""learning"" to drive at night isn't going to help any... I'll emphasize this, if she cannot see well at night, don't even force her, it's safer for her and anyone else on the road. I hope you don't feel like I'm attacking...

Anti-inflammatory diet plus eyelid hygiene has sent my Schirmer numbers back to normal. Ophthalm. says he would not diagnose me with blepharitis now. My eyes feel dry sometimes, especially in AM.

My vision is -3.50 in both eyes and I can basically just see blurred color without my glasses on. I then realized that only my right eye could see well. My left was still the same. I booked in to see my eye dr again the next day. She was immediately concerned. She did a pressure test and read that my right eye was now a 0.0. It had fully improved to 20/20 vision. She did some scans and showed me that my macula looked very strange and that it Appeared to be wrinkled. She said I needed to be seen by an ophthalmologist. She told me that typically what causes the macula to wrinkle is from pressure behind the eye. This is also what causes the improved vision as it shortens the lens of the eye. She told me her concern was that there may be a tumor behind my eye. Cue freaking out. The next day I was seen by an ophthalmologist at the hospital. He did a ton of tests and scans and agreed with my optometrists concerns. He saw the wrinkling on my macula and sent me straight for a CT. He told me his concern was also a tumor. 2 hours later I was back in his office and he gave me the news that the CT was clear. No tumor. He said he was extremely surprised as he was quite convinced it was a tumor. He then told me I needed to be seen by a retina specialist as he believed the blood vessels behind my eye were swollen and had no idea on the reason. Again, the next day, I saw the retina specialist. He must have spent 30 minutes looking at my eye at a ton of different angles. He said ""wow this is an interesting one for a Saturday morning!""<U+009D> He thought maybe my optic nerve was a bit swollen but not very much. He also agreed that I had coroidal folds on my macula and had absolutely no idea why. He is a renowned doctor and said he's very stumped by my case and said he will dig deep to find answers. He said he believes there is sort of rate condition or disease causing this. He said the vision shift from a -3.50 to a 0 is extremely concerning and that we absolutely need to find the cause. On Monday I have a ton more scans at his office, an ultrasound and a Fluorescein angiography. He's going to be working with my neurologist to see if they can figure out what's going on. I feel scared and also just really tired. I want to know what's going on and no one seems to have a clue. If you made it this far - I appreciate your thoughts and time! Here's to a diagnosis sometime soonish! ",reddit,1,1

8914,"It's possible you were having issues getting the best prescription because your eyes have been dry. Dryness will alter the surface of your eye. This can cause fluctuating astigmatism values or inaccurate measurements from the machines or whoever is doing the refraction (optometrist most likely). Regardless of what you choose to do, is recommend treating the dry eye aggressively to see if this helps your overall situation. Use an artificial tear 4 times a day in both eyes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). Use the drop even if you don't feel you need it. If you use the tears more than 4-6 times a day, switch to a preservative free variety. Also, don't use anything with a redness reducer. So avoid visine, clear eyes, ophcon, naphcon, and lumify. I'd suggest a brand like refresh, blink, Systane, liquitears, Genteal, or theratears. There are a bunch of brands but you can use any, even the cheapest is a good place to start. In addition, do a hot compress once a day for 5 minutes (heat a washcloth under hot water and rest it on the closed eyes). Once the 5 minutes are over, take the heat off the eyelids and gently massage the eyelids with your fingers. This will also help improve the quality of your tears. Furthermore, if you work on screens often or read a lot or do focused near work (knitting, puzzles, crosswords, painting...), this is contributing to your dry eye surface. Follow what's called the 20/20/20 rule. Every 20 minutes is focused work/tv/computer..., take a 20 second break where you look up from what you're doing and look 2 feet away. It will help remind you to blink and reduce strain. You should also put an extra eye drop in before doing your focused activity to help keep the surface lubricated. Another important thing to know is your age. If you're under 16, your glasses are much more important for the health of your eyes and you need the most accurate prescription. If you're older than that, wearing any glasses won't hurt your eyes. But if you're wearing the wrong prescription, things will be blurry and you're more likely to get eye strain and headaches while using the glasses. Just because you are given a prescription for glasses doesn't mean you have to get it. If you're concerned the prescription isn't great, get another opinion and a new refraction (preferably after treating your dry eyes for at least 2-4 weeks). You'll be glad it only cost you a glasses exam fee instead of having to buy two pairs of glasses (which can get quite costly). ",reddit,0,0
8915," I spend the day thinking about how horribly dry I am, nothing I do improves, I can hardly sleep and I can't stop thinking about the future. I'm starting to fear that I can't take it and I don't know what to do. Have you been through this? I don't know how you live day by day with this, my mouth is killing me and I know that these are only the initial symptoms. is this because of anxiety and fear? When you get used to the disease, can you take it ""normally""? I am afraid that the little saliva I have will disappear and I will have nothing left or that my eyes will dry out even more. I am also afraid that it could be something more serious, like amidoilosis, I saw that it can dry your mouth and eyes, and make your tongue with teeth marks on the edges, which I have. There are times when I think, uh, it's just dry, you shouldn't be like that because of that, but it's horrible I can't handle it.

I am \*extremely\* careful about that now, but I took a hormone test (the DUTCH test) last spring, and it said my cortisol was super high all day long.

There's a direct correlation between inflammation caused by disease (or from diet, outside factors, etc) and it messing up your brain's signaling to your ovaries telling them it's safe to ovulate.

The laser based method is much more accurate and with better results according to him also, that's why this kind of procedure was abandoned after a while, it is still used in some regions in Europe and in the world (mostly in India).

When I was 28, I had a staph infection in my right eye for six months and when the final eye patch came off - I was totally blind in that eye. Four cornea specialists later, I was finally diagnosed with KC. I had a cornea transplant the following day and it has lasted me 41 years. The life expectancy of a transplant is 10-15 years so I've been lucky. Both eyes developed cataracts when I was 45 years old, but I had surgery on both a month later and it was a breeze. I've had quite a few procedures through the years due to severe abrasions on my cornea. Very few people wear contact lenses from age 15 to age 70 (now) without issues, but it's never been a choice for me. Now, my vision is about 20/80 and I wear readers most of the time to get to 20/40.

He was describing it to me as a bit like a dried dessert with brown and blue pigment. Hes asked me to come back in 12 months time just to check it again, out of his fascination he said.

Clearly accurate measurements are necessary and there are different lenses that offer different diameters and base curves for lenses. So then what about a corneal topographer or keratometer? I get what your trying to say that due to soft lenses being well soft an exact fit doesn't sound necessary. But can you prove that to me? There isn't really alot of trust on my end here from dealing with doctors who don't want to release prescriptions to dealing with doctors who don't think abbe values are necessary I have little trust when I hear someone say they don't think it's necessary.

No change. (Doctor said I have slight astigmatism, but not near the threshold for needing correction. This contact didn't really fix it, so hopefully that is not my issue. Besides, toric lenses did *not* agree with me, pretty uncomfortable.) * Air Optix Night & Day, -2.0 in on eye and -2.25 in another eye. No change. * Air Optix (same plain version), increased strength to -2.25 in both eye. Better, but still out of focus.

Third, whatever I know about CXL comes from reading, a lot of it in this subreddit. The accelerated procedures use stronger UV lights as far as I know. I have not heard of any difference in the pain. What I have read is that the procedure itself is essentially painless because of the anesthetics that are used. The recovery ranges from uncomfortable to painful but that seems to be mostly for the day or two following and dependent on the individual. Some have even reported one eye being painful and the other not. Removal of the epithelium, saturating the cornea with riboflavin, and exposure to strong UV light are all going to irritate the cornea. Probably like skinning your knuckle and getting a sunburn combined. So it is not surprising that it takes a bit of time to get over that.

I was given a pamphlet with information, told to look into sclerals, and was sent on my way. Fast forward 2 months and $1600 later I have sclerals. I hated them and couldnt even get them in right. So I just used my glasses for the most part. My right eye still had 20/20 with glasses at this point. That didnt last very long. About 3 months later around July I start noticing double vision in my right eye as well, although a lot less severe. It was pretty clear it was getting worse fast. So here I go to new doctor that specializes in crosslinking. I get all the tests done and find out I'm a great candidate due to the cornea still being about 495 microns thick. They give me pricing information and even set a tentative date. It felt like I was being sold on it without much info. Here is a disclaimer. Do not trust the internet and strangers on everything. Instead use it as a tool. Thats what I did when I started looking into going to Canada for CXL + PRK. I was not happy with how the doctors treated me and my situation here in Texas. It felt like I was just another patient who didn't matter. I called around to the major clinics that did this, lasik MD, PLEC, etc. I finally decided on PLEC after doing a lot of research. The Dr. There had not only good reviews but the experience and knowledge to do it. Every other individual doctor I looked into was far less experienced from what research I did. So off I go and set up the appointment to get this done. All I had to do was send in my scans and they confirmed I was a candidate. I fly there on a Monday for the initial consultation and some more scans. Tuesday one last test. I got to see Vancouver which is absolutely beautiful. Wednesday my wife flew in and I had the procedure done. The next day I went back for a check up and Friday we flew out. I wont go into detail about the pain and irritation of the first day. There are enough posts about that. The first 2 weeks are very rough and I recommend you take them off from work or school. After that it starts to get better. So here we are. 6 months later and my dominant right eye is sitting at 20/15 vision. Its never been better and it's pretty much stabilized. My left eye which was much worse is sitting somewhere around 20/40 or 20/50. They are putting me back on some prescription drops to see if the left Eye improves a bit. Overall the experience of the surgery is something I hope never to repeat. The pain and light sensitivity are pretty damn bad. The blurriness is horrible. The money spent is quite a lot at least for me. I would do it all over in a heartbeat though. I have better vision now than before with no current signs of progression. I dont have anxiety over possibly not being able to drive. The doctor and entire staff at PLEC were and continue to be great. They still check on me and my tests once my optometrist sends them in. Shout out to my optometrist as well she has been great through all of this. I'll continue getting my check ups when necessary and hopefully I wont ever need another round of CXL. To anyone going through this right now. There are options and there is light at the end of the tunnel. My path may not be right for everyone. I suggest you talk to your doctors. Get a second opinion if you feel you need one. Do all the research you can and if you have a good doctor trust what they say. Feel free to ask any questions you might have. ",reddit,1,1
8948,"Well, in 2004 I was diagnosed by one of the top ophthalmologists in the US at an internationally respected eye institute run by a university medical school based on the condition of my corneas and the overall dryness and high inflammation in my body. No one (meaning no other health professional) has ever questioned the diagnosis. I was lucky to see him, it was just before he retired. It was my local ophthalmologist who got me in to see him and my rheumatologist agreed with the dx. I also have sero-negative RA, if that helps. Sorry, that's all the info I have, but my corneas were/are extremely dry and I make very little tears or saliva or any other moisture in my body -- and it wasn't just low tears, he mentioned something about which specific portion of the tears was missing (but I don't remember for sure, I think it was the oily layer???) At that point Restasis, eye soaks and everything else had failed to control the problem. Now I am on ASEDs, which help but -- as we all know -- there is as yet no treatment for the root cause of Sjogren's, only for the symptoms. It is so frustrating trying to get a diagnosis, even now! That is, I am firmly convinced, because health insurance companies run our healthcare ""system"" instead of doctors and are always wanting to limit having to cover conditions. ( I know this as a retired heatlhcare professional.) It took me about 20 years to get sero-negative RA diagnosed, but those were the bad-old-days when it was not believed to exist. I mention this because there are definite cervical issues with RA and you mentioned your neck. I wish you the very best -- keep pushing! Don't give up! Someday we will have a (sure to be very, very expensive) treatment for the root causes of Sjogren's because you can bet those pharmaceutical companies want the profit! TL;DR: Diagnosed based on cornea condition and tear composition at a top medical research eye clinic. ",reddit,0,0
8949,"The ZCB00 is a monofocal IOL that induces 27 microns of negative spherical aberration. So it has wavefront properties designed to offset the 27 microns of positive spherical aberration that older people accumulate on average over a lifetime. So it's not an aspherically neutral monofocal IOL. I have the B&L Akreos in the right eye. I didn't say it was more reliable. I just said that I'm doing fine with it. I'm sure a lot of people have the ZCB00 and love it. I didn't intend to advocate for a particular IOL, or to bash a particular IOL. Instead, my point was to establish that many of these technologies may have unintended, poorly understood side effects, in addition to whatever genuinely positive effect you might get. As such simpler may be safer. My understanding is that surgeons receive most of their experience explanting IOLs from multifocal IOLs. I also think it's important to understand ones own motivations. My experience with people who have compromised vision, including myself, is that we are all susceptible to persuasion because we do deeply wish our vision problems would disappear. Once you have done a certain level of research, understand all the contextual factors in play, you have to go forward on your decision, whatever it is. ",reddit,0,0

8953,Hi this is my exsperiance i hope reading it may answer some of your questions. I had a cornea transplant in my left eye in dec 2017 at age 28 I have worn hard contact lenses for 15 years but the cornea became too scard and distorted. I saw a special specialist doctor and went through all the alternatives with me in my case the other options were crosslinking but i was to advanced for that and slerical lenses which did not seem practical to me so i took the graft option. I live in nz so i was lucky enough to get the procedure through the public health system for free. Ill be straight up the first two weeks after the surgery were hell i stayed with my parents to look after me. Even though my other eye wasnt operated on it took its toll on it and i couldn't really see for two weeks. Things got better after another three weeks i began to feel normal again but i took three months off work and then another three months doing part time i was lucky to have a good boss who was really good about it all. Two years later they began removing the sutures a couple at a time and thats when i began to notice the vision improving. That took 18months and takes me too where i am today wearing a lense again in the left eye. As a result of the trauma to the eye from the graft i did develop a cataract which is now distorting my vision and my next path is cataract surgery sometime this year. Summing up eye pain can be an issue at times and can drive you mad but i recommend just sleep it off. Im happy i had the graft as it greatly improved my vision. ,reddit,0,1

8988,"Hi there, I am 32 and was told I have ME/CFS 2 years ago. However, I believe in my case this is the Sjogren's causing all the fatigue. To complicate everything, I was also diagnosed with Graves disease in August and already had Hashimoto since 2009... Your symptoms could point up to a flare yes. I am currently experiencing one which started 3 weeks ago. The smoke in the air and extra stress were triggers. The best things to do are to rest, take high quality fish oil (for me it works to calm down the inflammation in my lower back but everyone reacts differently to medication so you would want to talk to your rheumatologist first.) The dryness in the mouth and eyes has gradually worsened since 2018. I have seen an ophthalmologist 2 weeks ago who agrees that it looks like Sjogren's, as my tear production is abnormally low and I also have very dry mouth. I have talked to 2 different rheumatologists since May. The first one told me I am tired because I have CFS... The second one doesn't take a stand concerning Sjogren's. He first said it's highly likely as I have moderately elevated ANA antibodies and all my symptoms, but then changed his mind at the next call, only to change his mind again at our last phone call and said :""It could still be Sjogren's."" I know I have Sjogrens and am lucky my new ophtalmologist agreed with me and sent a letter to the rheumatologist. The rheumatologist refuses to give treatment other than Pilocarpine for saliva production. My insurance doesn't cover it so I can't try it as it would cost around $300/month (Canadian dollars). He also said that Plaquenil won't help with the deep fatigue. I have had to quit working since 2018 and I really want to have a better quality of life.

8990,"I've had this issue for as long as I can remember (I'm 20 now). I had a MRI before COVID but they didn't see anything (they looked for tumors or excess pressure). An ophthalmologist looked at the scan too and said everything looked pretty much normal. Apparently I have a slightly narrow optical nerve though, not sure if that's relevant. An optometrist once offered some fancy prism lenses that are apparently supposed to help but my insurance doesn't cover them. I've moved states since COVID started and no one's taking new patients except for really basic stuff.

There's a space from about 4 inches from my face to about 1.5 feet away that'a really hard to me to focus in. This is because it's too far away for me to see without glasses but too close to see with them. Nothing's blurry, but sometimes letters overlap or double. This makes it really hard to wear contacts because the same thing happens, only I can't take my contacts out every time I want to read. Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening? Is there a name for this? My brother, sister, and dad all have the same thing but me and my sister have it the worst. Edit: some more info: My migraines are pretty severe usually. I sometimes get nauseous and throw up and usually have to lie down for an entire day. If I manage to notice it before it gets bad I can reduce the severity by taking painkillers (acetaminophen) and not focusing on anything within 6 or so feet. My migraines have a sharp pain between/slightly above my eyes. The migraines started around three years ago and have very slowly increased in severity and frequency, although I've gotten better at managing them. It affects my life because I'm a developer and I have to read text on a screen all day. This increases my chances of accidentally getting too close to the screen and getting a migraine. If I get a migraine I can't work because focusing on small stuff like works hurts really bad. ",reddit,1,1

It was later revealed that his natural lens in his eye went bad and it had to be replaced, just like cataract surgery.

KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy. He is going to put me into scleral lenses. I get fitted on 9-1 and I and hope to get 20/20 once again :( Cornea transplants are NOT supposed to last this long. I am an exception to the rule.

9000,"A few years ago I began having slight issues with my vision. At first it was just that with certain headlights ( I think the newer LED ones) I would see a duplicate set of headlights underneath it but in blue. It literally looks like they installed a separate set of headlights right under the first but in blue. Initially it was only when I looked out the side of my eyes but has since become an all time thing. Then came the motion blur with anything lit up in a dim room. A remote, my phone, whatever had any glow to it will leave a very slow light trail behind it. Then came motion blur with anything white. Flipping through a book, wiping something with a paper towel etc. Then the colors that shouldn't be there showed up. Usually it's purple ( when looking at an all white spot like a field of snow, or at a red light a purple haze will be under the red glow) but sometimes is blue. Also when I look across anything lit up a flash of light goes the opposite way. If theres a candle for example and I look to the left of it, I will immediately get a flash of light going to the right. I have recently begun seeing random flashes of purple in my peripheral vision. I also have motion blur now with pretty much anything. My own hands ( I'm a brown skinned person so they're not white at all) and anything I move with them. I also now struggle to see white lit things like the captions on television which now also have a blue outline, and the time on my stove. I also struggle with getting my brain ro let go of an image it has seen. A lot of times it's the pattern of the brake lights from the car in front of me , sometimes 10 minutes after I have seen them. I have eye Drs who listen and examine me thoroughly but see nothing wrong with my eyes. In the past year my vision got blurrier and it seems like every thing would be fine if there was just more light. I did get a new prescription and am waiting for the glasses to come in so maybe that will help with the blurriness but it's been odd. Also when I'm looking at my phone what looks like a negative image of what I'm seeing flashes to the side of my screen. And today the sun was high on the right upper section of my vision but I saw a dark spot the same size as it on my left as well. I am 36 years old. I have a family history of macular degeneration and I myself have somewhat controlled diabetes. I get diabetic eye exams yearly. No visual damage is there. I recently tried seeing a new dr who gave me a test to check how things were with my brain since my eyes seem fine. She sat me in front of a screen with a wire on my scalp and had me watch a tv screen of black and white images. She said the results came back as me having "" a delay"" but won't say what that means only that she wants to talk to my neurologist. . This has been several weeks of anxiety and worrying and I still have no answers because she keeps forgetting about me. Of importance , probably, is the fact that I have had 3 MRIs over the years to check for MS because of odd sensations and muscle movements that are otherwise unexplained. All have come back unremarkable, the most recent a few months ago. It was ordered because in December of 2019 I developed nearly non stop twitching in my eyes and the muscles surrounding them. The twitching eventually spread to my cheeks and lips and has calmed down most everywhere now except my eyes, both of which have fluttering anywhere from right below my eyebrows to my under eye area. It's happening nearly continuously although it's only sometimes visible . The only sites I can find about the test I had showing a delay basically said it's a clear indication of MS. While I definitely don't want MS , if that's where this is heading after all these years of "" is it or isn't it"" then I definitely want to know and to get any meds I can to slow progression. But even when I looked into MS visual symptoms nothing I have been going through seems to be mentioned minus the blurred vision which may be age related regression. All this said.. does anyone have any suggestions to what may be going on? I am uncomfortable using my vision as it is but am terrified of it getting worse or losing it. Could this be MS? Something else? Any advice or ideas would be great, google is NOT my friend but is coming up empty handed anyway. ",reddit,1,1
9001,I'm -5.0 myopic in both eyes and I'm now 36. My vision got bad enough to need glasses when I was about 12 and it got steadily worse until I was in my twenties. But then it settled down and my prescription rarely changes much these days. When you've stopped growing your prescription should settle down a bit. I don't believe there's any research which shows that wearing corrective lenses has a BIG impact on future vision. Most people's myopia is down to the shape of the eye rather than usage. Of course when you get older you'll experience changes in your comfortable reading distance but that'll be down to your age and the reduced flexibility of the lens in your eye. But that's a different thing to being short-sighted. So don't worry. With your level of short-sightedness and your age I very much doubt it will get too much worse. ,reddit,1,1

To my recollection I've never had this happen with my own eye exams. My glasses are being made atm, and I'm obviously going to try them out since the refraction and everything went very smooth and I was happy with my choices through the ""1 or 2"" stuff, but I'm really curious about this because it's new to me. For what it's worth, this is my new prescription: OD |. Sphere: -4.00 |. CYL: -0.50 |. Axis: 175 OS |. Sphere: -4.75 |. CYL: 0.00 |. Axis: 180 PD 60.00/57.00 (I've always oscillated between a 58-60 PD but I'm a little confused on the two numbers) My contacts are just the basic non-spheric Acuvue Oasys lenses with -4.50 in both eyes (originally the right was -4.00 but they were a bit fuzzy so he bumped it up to match the other which happens often with me in contacts - my right eye usually has to be a bit stronger for some reason). My old RX: 68 OD |. Sphere: -4.25 |. Axis: 168 OS |. CYL: -0.75 |. Axis: 178 Again, a really minor change but the CYL being nonexistent on the new one is throwing me off. I will say though, that wearing my new contacts RX now, my left eye is *really* crystal clear and I'm not having the usual ""wait for the lens to readjust"" that I always used to get with both eyes which I understand is due to astigmatism.

9013,"Hello everyone, I would like to reach to you experts/enthusiasts as I am unable to put a name on my condition. I've been diagnosed with hypermetropia in both eyes, although stronger in my right eye, very early in my life (must have been 1 year old or so) and had strabismus. Wore glasses ever since until I was 13-14 years old, had eye patches to help strenghten my RIGHT eye. I felt unbelievably uncomfortable trying to see and function only with my right eye, the reason is that the vision from that eye is horrible, and frustratingly hard to explain as well. I finally found a way to describe it and I'm hoping for some answers: Imagine how you are staring at the sun for too long and thus getting a blind spot right in the middle of your vision, to me it, usually looks purple afterwards and for some time until it heals. Now, what I see in my right eye could be hundreds or more tiny blindspots making it impossible to read on my phone. Those blindspots don't have a color, instead it looks like I see through them, this isn't a problem if I'm looking at something plain like a pink T-shirt. I believe my brain tries to fill up the empty spaces but fails miserably once I try to read something small enough. Bonus: I did notice that my colors in my right eye seem very slightly less bright, I had to switch from left to right eye at least 10 times to confirm that.

I have to wear glasses all the time because I only have 1 eye with decent vision, so they want me to keep it protected with good lenses. I have worn glasses all my life so I was fine with that. They recommended I go for computer vision (basically arms length). It seemed logical, I spend a lot of time on the computer and if I am going to go without glasses, at my computer seemed to be safest. If I had a time machine and could make another choice? I want to be able to see up close without glasses again! My whole life if something was difficult to see I could just move it closer to my face and could see it. Now, I play this game of putting on my reading glasses, then my distance glasses, then no glasses while moving it closer and farther away to find just the right spot. Since my surgery, my advice for everyone has been this... If you have vision now that works without glasses, pick the lens that will replicate that. However, your son is in a unique position of being very young and needing a lens for each eye. I would talk to the surgeon about correcting one eye for distance and the other for near.

9023,"I've been a uncontrolled diabetic for a few years. I finally bit the bullet and went into the doctor to get it under the control. Initial A1C was 13, now its 9.7 and falling after 2 months. Working on diet and exercise and trending in the right direction. Still have shame for letting it get this far, but I cant change the past. I'm 47M. I went into the optometrist to get a checkup. I had lasik back in 2000, now I have slight nearsightedness and I wear progressive bifocals. No vision complaints, but I went to check it out. Doctor saw some diabetic changes in the eye (non-proliferative), and asked me to see a retinal specialist to monitor. I made an appointment for January. Three days later, I woke up with redness, crustiness and as the morning progressed, \*severe\* pain whenever any light changes. Like a stabbing in my head. I was down for the count. Got in the next day, diagnosed with uveitis and put on steroid drops and a drop to dilate my eyes. Pain went away almost immediately, although my vision continued to be wonky - I assumed because of the dilating drop. Checked in with the Optometrist, and when I complained about the vision he did another retinal scan and noticed changes from just a few days before. I got into the retinal specialist on a priority basis . He said that I have macular edema, which is causing my blurred vision in my left eye. However, he couldnt ascertain if it was diabetic related or related to the uveitis (or if I already had some edema before, and the addition of the uvetitis caused my vision changes). He initially wanted to do a dye study to study the blood flow (not sure exactly what), to apparently help him determine a course of action. When I couldnt do it right then, he put me on on Toradol (generic) drops, and asked to come back in a week. I'm due to go back in a couple of days, which will be 2 weeks from that sudden onset uveitis. Some questions I have (for him, of course, but wondering if anyone wanted to chime in): 1. The sudden onset of it is weird. Is it possible that something in the eye exam unwittingly triggered it? The dilation drops? Or maybe trauma from me rubbing it because of the dilation? 2. I'm going to get worked up for autoimmune disorders next time I see my primary. But from what I understand, if its just the one time it's often idiopathic? 3. Will more time on steroid/nsaids be worth trying before any sort of injectable or other treatment? Frankly, I freaked out (silently) when I got my Lasik and I'm leery of the idea of injectables. (If I have to, I have to, of course). If there's a risk to waiting, though, I'll get what I need to done. 4. What value does the dye study have diagnostically? 5. Is there a chance that the relatively rapid decline in my A1C/sugar levels can cause something like this? I read anecdotally that doing so can cause retinopathy to flareup. If so, whats the likelihood that this will fade with time? Is there a way to determine if this is the case? I appreciate any insight or experience you care to share. Thanks! ",reddit,1,1

So every time my mom took me to get my eyes checked (my prescription is pretty hefty) I never said anything about seeing two. That was, until I was 16. It was just a normal checkup""<U+0080><U+009D>me my mom and my brother. The doctor put in the lenses in those temporary glasses they give you test the prescription. I put them on and said ""everything is clearer, but it makes me see double a lot more. (This normally happens when I get a new prescription but I felt the need to voice it this time) The doctor looked confused and asked me what I meant. I just repeated myself, assuming that she should know what I was talking about. This was her job after all. But she suddenly got very concerned. She took the glasses off me, projected the letter 'F' on the wall, and told me to look thru the machine again. I did. She then asked me, ""How many do you see? I was very confused. I asked her to clarify and she goes. ""How many F's do you see on the wall right now? ""Two. (According to my mom, I said ""Two in this sorta ""duh voice, tho I can't remember that) She got even more concerned and messed with the machine a bit. She then asked me to use my hands to measure how far the images were. Once I did, there was a click and the images got CLOSER. So I moved my hands closer. And closer. And closer and closer. With each click I could literally see my vision getting corrected. 25+ clicks later and my hands clapped together. I started crying. I had never seen a single image before. Sure, I've lived with it long enough to where I don't notice it 90% of the time, but I've never been able to look thru one of those things and see One Picture. That was the day I learned I had extremely bad Binocular Diplopia and the only fix was prisms. (She tried putting my entire prescription and prisms in the test glasses but they wouldn't all fit). Apparently I need a size 10 prism. I currently have a size 7 (no place nearby sold size 10 plus prescription) but am planning to get my full prescription soon. The point of me typing all of this up was to ask if there was anyone else out there like me? I've never met/talked to someone who has it, let alone has lived with it they're entire life.

In America (I think) you can choose between epi-off and epi-on (whether they remove the epidermis or not). Epi-on is less painful in the days after the procedure but recovery can be 3 months and epi-off is very painful for the first 36-48 hours (from my experience) but recovery time (for rough vision) is under a week. In the UK, where I'm from, they only do epi-off as it's recommended by NICE but I don't have any idea on how other countries do it.

9043,"I am a 36 yo myopic male with bilateral retinoschisis discovered during a routine eye exam 2 years ago (optos image). It was initially thought to be a retinal detachment by the optometrist, but subsequent exam by an ophthalmologist determined it to be a retinoschisis (with holes). Preventive laser surgery was performed to wall off the defect in hopes that it may prevent spread. It was explained to me that there is no assurance it would be successful in this regard. The right eye is more severe, and I do have a blind spot in my upper-left field of vision in that eye (I never noticed it until my ophthalmologist pointed it out to me). Fast forward to today. I was initially told it wouldn't be an issue if I were to proceed with lasik in the future. During my pre-op lasik exam last week, the optometrist appeared very concerned and referred me back to my retina doc for an evaluation and clearance for lasik. Today I saw an ophthalmologist (same practice as before, different physician) who stated that the barrier appears to be holding and the schisis is at this point stable, as compared to two years ago. I asked again if lasik would be ok and he stated that there could be a higher risk of complications like detachment, but that the literature shows that there is an association, but not necessarily causal link between lasik and severe complications. The way he put it, I could have severe complications with or without lasik, and he cleared me for the procedure. So I've been reading about lasik and I'm reading that there is a lot of pressure placed on the eye, with changes in intraocular pressure etc. It makes me a little nervous and I thought I'd see if you fine folks had any input or guidance on the matter. Am I at a significantly higher risk of severe post op complications because of my condition? Or should I consider my risk level to be similar to any other myopic individual undergoing lasik?

I also noticed that I get double vision when i'm using my new glasses while working. I can't stare at my computer or anything close with those glasses so I wear my old prescription whenever i'm looking at something close. After wearing the new glasses I noticed that even without them, my eye sight is getting blurry even when i'm just using my phone. It wasn't like this when I was using still using my old one or before getting a new prescription. Anyone else in their 20s and eye sight is still progressing? I'm sad. Sigh. I went back to my optometrist last Feb 11 because my sclera is always red and I feel like my eyes are always strained. So he said it was because of eye allergies and gave me Pataday and Systane Ultra. Got better however, I went to the doctor today (feb 27) for my follow up check up the redness is gone, still kinda dry but the redness cleared up. Told him that I have been seeing waves/mirage without wearing my glasses and so he checked my eye grade again and from -4.00 and -4.25 in a span of 2 months it is now -5.00. I'm so confused.

9054,"I was encouraged to post this even though it is not specific, practical information because people might find it hopeful. So here goes, but don't ask me for more info because this is all I know: I have had RA for about decades and Sjogren's for at least 12 years with significant symptoms. I have ILD due to one of them, my rheumatologist said there is no way to know which one. I am on a biologic which really helps my RA, but we all know that as of right now there is no biologic treatment for Sjogren's. However, my rheumatologist said that there is research being done in Europe and he thinks that perhaps in 2023 there will be results published which are hopeful re JAK inhibitors or other pathways. The EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism, their equivalent to the ACR or American College of Rheumatology, i.e. a professional organization for rheumatologists) published this article which you can read for more info: [https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3) To summarize the main point, they say that much of the problem with prior research could be addressed by more careful selection of study participants, bigger placebo groups, and determining the genetics and separating out people who only have ""sicca-related disease"" from people who have systemic disease: . Therapeutic research in SjS should probably be reconsidered in order to explore new pathogenic targets outside the glandular tissue (ie, neuroendocrine pathways), and to search for a more personalised therapeutic approach based on genetic, clinical, immunological and/or histopathological characteristics. It is not improbable that future RCTs would benefit from more selected patient cohorts, possibly including newly diagnosed SjS patients, the findings of early salivary gland ultrasound changes,[101""<U+0080><U+009C>103](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3#ref-101) or evidence of early high disease activity at diagnosis[22](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3#ref-22) before permanent damage has been established and the changes are still reversible. Patients with sicca-limited disease differ from those with systemic disease, as do immune-negative patients from those carrying Ro autoantibodies or cryoglobulins, while recent etiopathogenic studies are beginning to divide SjS patients according to the genetic profile between those with or without a predominant IFN-I gene expression signature.[104""<U+0080><U+009C>106](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3#ref-104) Sensitivity analyses searching for a differentiated response to therapies in these subsets of patients (sicca-limited vs systemic; Ro+ vs Ro-; positive vs negative salivary gland biopsy; positive vs negative IFN-I signature) might help to better delineate the therapeutic effect of a drug tested in primary SjS, although this would require a greater number of patients randomised than those included in reported trials. DON'T get too excited if you read this article as it is from 2019 and the study on abatacept mentioned below did not have positive results, but again that may be due to the study design. It might be helpful for certain Sjogren's patients more than others. My rheumatologist said perhaps the JAK biologics will work better. With respect to ongoing trials, considerable interest is centred on the B cell survival factor (BAFF) pathway, investigating the effect of monoclonal antibodies targeting BAFF-receptor or the association between B-cell depletion and BAFF inhibition. In addition, studies are testing inhibition of other pathways activating B cells. Lastly, four ongoing trials are testing other pathways or the use of other cytokine-based therapies including tocilizumab, abatacept, filgotinib (a janus kinase inhibitor) and human recombinant Il-2. I'm a healthcare professional (not an MD) and our joke in my professional group was that the conclusion from every study is -- sadly, for us -- almost always ""more research is needed"". But what I like about this article is, as in the first quoted paragraph above, they are thinking about HOW to refine future research. Let's hope! ",reddit,0,0
9055,"NITM = near-induced transient myopia, this is basically myopia that results from extensive near work only for a short-period due to a spasm of the muscle responsible for accommodation, or focusing on near objections. We might also call this pseudomyopia. This study looked at additivity and decay of transient myopia in people with different refractive errors. The question of addivity is basically, does more time spent on near work = more pseudomyopia? The question of decay is how long does it take for the pseudomyopia to resolve i.e. for the near focusing muscles to relax? Near work can definitely lead to pseudo myopia in the short-term (like in the study). There may also be a connection between significant prolonged near work and the development of actual myopia, though this is somewhat controversial. In any case, taking a break every 20 minutes or so to look 20 feet away or more will likely increase visual comfort, decrease the likelihood of pseudo myopia, and may even protect you from myopic progression.

Obviously this is highly subjective on my part, and the part of my patients. Of course there are those patients that seemly don't care at all about prescription changes, and yet others that claim they can differentiate .01D and <U+00BC> axis changes. There are 55 year people with +2.00 -1.25 x 090 with +2.25add that will tell you they see perfectly fine everywhere without glasses. But in my experience the majority of people would notice improvement between these two prescriptions(still just talking right eye obviously) if they are shown the difference between the two. I would say that there would be fewer people with complaints if they didn't have the reference of the other Rx to compare it to. In other words, If someone's ""correct"" Rx is -50 -75 x 090 and they are given -75 -.25 x 125, there would be less objections than if they were given the opportunity to trial frames both Rx. Because they have no reference that it could be better. What is significant in a clinical description is different than what is subjectively significant in a dispensing setting. ",reddit,0,0

9090,"I can relate... I've been waering RGP lenses for about 10 years now. The fitting was a real pain in the butt especially on my right eye on which the keratoconus is very advanced in the last stage and on which I have a large scar on my cornea which prevented my lense from ever fitting correctly on that eye. Since my contacts have always been kinda uncomfortable I was using a lot of preservative free solutions and drops the meant to imitate tears. I used ""Hylo Comod"" which can be used while wearing your4 contacts. In addition my eyes got very sticky and my vision got very blurry over long day with warm and dry air around me for which I couldn't find anything for a long time. For a almost a year now tho, I have a daily eye cleaning routine in the morning where I clean my eye lids. There are certain pores on the brink of the eye lid that give off an oily solution that is part of your natural tears. My pores are clogged tho from time to time which makes it diffucult. I'm using ""Lipo Nit"" for this. Regarding scleral lenses. I'm currently switching to full scleral lenses at the moment because wearing the corneal lense became to painful on my right eye. I got the first scleral lense on nmy right eye in MArch and I'm absolutely in love with them. It took two tries to make it right but the final feeling was jsut great. Or should I say there was no feeling at all since I couldn't tell if I was wearing any lenses at all. Noe I could even roll my eyes without having my lenses disappear somewhere behind my eye lids... I also haven't had any issues with my scleral lense and my environment. Not with dust. Not with wind. Not with rain. The only problem that I have is that I sometimes have to change the solution at some point of the day because my vison gets a bit blurry. Mostly I have to do that 1 or 2 hours after I put them in first. I use little saline vials without any preservatives to fill my contact lense. I would also suggest that you keep trying to find a better fitting lense. If you keep struggeling with your mini scleral lenses you could think about upgrading to the really big ones. They look a bit intimidating but they feel great and nowadays, they are really safe to use and you don't have to fear that your eye suffers from lack of oxygen. I hope things work out for you!

I had strabismus surgery in 1997, when I was 6, and it went okay, but I had to continue wearing glasses and eventually, strabismus came back. I also developed amblyopia in my right eye. For several years, my deviation was very low, so I didn't mind using glasses. I even could do sports without them as my eyesight wasn't that bad. In 2005 I started wearing contacts and I continued using them for years. Sometimes, my eye started deviating again and I had to change my prescription to find a balance for my eyes not to stress and get tired. In 2019, after +10 years without problems, one day while I was working, my eye started to go out of focus and deviating time and time again. It happened during the next few days and I went to see an ophthalmologist, who changed my prescription (which was +2.25(L) , +3.00(R)) to a +2.00, +3.00, which made things better for a couple of weeks, until I started to lose control again. Those months I visited 5 or 6 doctors who gave me contacts from +2.00 to +3.50 for me to try on and see which one worked better, but none did, and I started getting depressed. This year I started trying multifocal contacts, and they seem much better than monofocals for my strabismus. I tried anything from Low Add to High Add. I was able to reduce my deviation, but my long distance view got worse, blurry. Whenever I try to make it clearer, I gain more deviation, so I'm in a situation where I don't know what to do. Headaches are common everyday, and I feel that my eyes will get crossed any time, which is makes me anxious. Surgery is not an option. Every doctor told me that. It seems that my accommodation is to high and, as it can be ""corrected"" with glasses and contacts, nobody wants to take the risk. So yeah...

9109,I only recently learned that retinol can cause dry eye. I've dry eyes for 20y or so. However my skin has always been v sensitive (can't use vit c or niacinamide products for example) so I have never used hard core retinol products. I do use The Ordinary's Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion. I don't associate it with making my eyes worse. The main issue I have is that I have developed dermatitis on my eyelids I'd say from all the scrubbing at my eyelid margin to try and keep it clear of blepharitis. I've bought a specialist product now for that and it does make my eyes feel dry. I spoke to the chemist and she recommended la roche posay eye cream as being mild enough for the eyelid. That is working for me at the moment. Otherwise I use NIOD products for skincare. I use their oily wash and their copper serum. Plus repigment for skin tone and the retinoid I mentioned above. I also use la Roche posay basic moisturiser and a face wash too. I'd say NIOD while great is aimed at older women. At 28 the main thing you should be using every day is sun screen.

9115,"Hi guys. I was diagnosed in 1998 (still in college). Had a horrible experience with hard contacts for almost three years - they gave me more corneal abrasions than I care to remember. I would start wearing them, follow the schedule, get used to them, get a corneal abrasions, have to stop and then rinse and repeat.

9121,"Yes, you do have to insert and remove your contact lenses every day. It is tricky at first but most people get pretty good at it within a few weeks. They shouldn't be uncomfortable if they fit well. But getting a good fit can be a challenge for KC patients. You want to find the best fitter you can. You need someone with the experience and the patience needed to fit KC patients. Because KC is rather rare, only a few contact lens fitters become good KC lens fitters. Some doctors are better than others at prescribing glasses for KC patients. I have had KC for over 50 years. When I was first diagnosed, KC lenses and fitting technology was primitive compared to today. I wore glasses for many years because they couldn't find comfortable contact lenses for me. When I found someone who had the knack for prescribing glasses for me, I stuck with them until they retired. Here are a few ideas that might help with helping your doctor find a good glasses prescription. The critical part of the exam is the subjective refraction with the phoropter. This is where you look through the funky ""glasses"" and select ""which is better, 1 or 2?"" Remember, it is the prescription that is being tested, not you. You are the grader. Don't strain or use tricks to try to see better. Just try to give each lens prescription presented to you an honest review based on the way you'd want to see through your glasses. Rather than trying to decide which image is better, something that has less meaning for someone with KC, try selecting the image you prefer. If both are bad, maybe in different ways, just say so. Same if both images are OK and you don't have a preference. If you can describe what makes the images bad, that may help your doctor. If you have a good rapport with your doctor, which is really helpful for KC patients, you might pass on these tips: ""Use 0.50DS steps or more when assessing sphere and cyl. It is often easier to assess the cyl before finalizing sphere correction, as large amounts of uncorrected astigmatism cause excessive ghosting."" That is advice for fitting Kerasoft contact lenses, but it would apply to any subjective refraction of a KC patient. What makes prescribing glasses tricky for KC patients is that you can't just methodically zero in on a good prescription like you can with normal eyes. With KC, things can get better, then worse, then better again as they try a series of lenses. Your doctor may have to spend time just jumping around trying to find the magic combination of sphere and cylinder power that works for you. You need someone who finds this interesting and is willing to spend the time playing with things. It will help if you can book your appointment at a time when the office is less busy and ask that they give the doctor extra time to spend with you because of your KC. I have seen some surprisingly good result with glasses despite my KC. My doctors have sometimes let on that they were surprised too. ",reddit,0,1

9130,"Hi everyone. I'm a 27yo woman, severely nearsighted (don't remember my prescription anymore, but it was above -10 for both my eyes, with a little bit of astigmatism in both). I had ICL surgery when I was 23. The reason for this was because I had stopped being able to tolerate contact lenses at 21, after 5 years of consistent use. I developed chronic dry eyes that were never successfully treated - I tried different things for them, never worked, and learned how to simply manage day by day. Because of my severely high myopia and having to go back to wearing impossibly thick glasses, I became depressed. People started making fun of me again just like they did in school. The guy I was seeing literally broke up with me over this. I couldn't go to the beach anymore because everything was so blurry, it caused me panic attacks. I quit surfing, which I loved, because of this. I thought my life was over. I tried very hard and pleaded with several doctors to let me try alternative kinds of contact lenses, like RGPs or sclerals. I was particularly excited about sclerals since they seem to be indicated for people with dry eye. My doctors always dismissed me, saying contacts would never work for me after what he had happened, and so did my parents. No one advocated for me and I was too young and too much of a pushover to advocate for myself. Eventually, and because my prescription was stable for several years, I was told I could get ICLs. LASIK was obviously always out of the question due to my prescription. I got the surgery done and my vision was never 20/20, there was always some residual nearsightedness and astigmatism that was never fully corrected. I never minded this because I hadn't been fully corrected in years anyway, and my sight was quite good and clear. Lately I've been wondering about what my options are if my vision worsens. I do not want to wear glasses ever again after the amount of unhappiness and trauma they've given me. I was talking to my mother about wearing contact lenses if I ever needed them again, and she casually dropped a bomb on me - ""the doctor told us after your surgery that you'll never be able to wear contact lenses again""<U+009D>. They hadn't told me this before. Will I never be able to try wearing contacts again after ICL? If this is the case I would've never gone forward with the surgery back then and would've pressed more for scleral lenses. What are my options if my vision worsens in the future? Is glasses really the only thing I can do? Are sclerals just not a possibility anymore? ",reddit,1,1
9131,"Clear vision is a great thing. Most young eyes are correctable to a visual acuity of 20/15, which is the first line beneath 20/20. With 20/15 vision, under good contrast, a person can make out objects separated by 1 foot at a distance of 4,500 feet. If a letter from an eye chart was constructed on a 5x5 grid the size of a 1-foot square, a person with 20/15 vision could just detect the letter from 300 yards away. This is about the limit of visual acuity for most eyes, though exceptional refractive media allow some lucky people to see as small as 20/12 or even 20/10. With 20/15 vision, one can make out the positioning of individual turbofans on a jet flying 35,000 feet overhead. Individual floors on city towers may be seen from 5-10 miles away.

Aesthetically, it causes severe left eyelid droop, and I still cannot completely close that eye. I've seen 3 ophthalmologists, all within the same small-town hospital system. Their only suggestions to deal with the severe evaporative dry eye are artificial tears and ointment at night. The artificial tears (and I've tried many kinds) do nothing, they are gone in minutes.

9139,"Thanks, I am glad you find them informative. Side effects: 1. When I take them out at night (16 hours of wear), they leave a temporary indentation on my sclera (white part of eye). This usually goes back to its normal position within an hour. I told my doctor about this and they said it is normal and does not negatively impact the health of the eye. 2. This also happens when I remove the lenses, my eyes get extremely bloodshot for at least 30 minutes. This is a reaction as the lens is pulled off of the sclera. Blood rushes to the area as the tissue rebounds to the normal position. Again, this is normal and not harmful, according to my doctor. Precautions: 1. I don't wear them in the shower and I never take a nap in them under any circumstances. â€”â€” Hypoxia risk is always present, as with any contact lens. My sclerals are made of an extremely oxygen permeable material that allows more oxygen to pass through than most soft contact lenses. I don't take them out for 18 hours after I put them in. I was told by my doctor that this is fine, but if my eyes started to feel irritated, remove the lenses. It's never been an issue. The first week I had the sclerals, I did have bubbles under the lenses after installation a couple times. This required immediate removal and reinstall. But now that it's been 6 months, I never have the issue. I can have both installed in about 1 minute (30 seconds per eye). It sounds like your eye doc isn't well trained in sclerals and fitting (no offense). My doc had the proper fit and lens shape within 5 minutes. Also taught me to install them in another 5 minutes. Your doc is correct in that if bubbles start forming at the edge of the lens, something is wrong with the fit and would need to be removed immediately. You want a good seal to keep the tear exchange minimal. Also means the lens is properly resting on your eye for optimal visual clarity. There are GP lenses that are more oxygen permeable than soft lenses. These are the lenses I wear (with the HydraPEG coating): https://www.artoptical.com/products/ampleye 6 months ago, before my sclerals, I was also in that deep dry-eye induced depression. I was using hundreds of dollars of OTC lubricating eye drops and several hundred dollars per month on prescription eye medications (steroids, Xiidra). I was so pissed. I paid 8k cash for the best, newest version of LASIK available. And it almost ruined my life. I tried everything and nothing kept my eyes moist enough to not feel dry. It severely impacted my visual acuity. I couldn't drive in low light and in the daytime I had severe halos and glare on just about object. Fast forward to today, I have sclerals. But I can see better than ever before in my life. It feels like I can see forever. Night vision is fine. My eyes never feel dry. I don't spend hundreds of dollars on eye drops every month.

My left eye which feels a little weak with my current (8/4/17) script has no cylinder or axis at the moment. The new script has an OS cylinder and axis of -0.5 and 150 respectively. I know nothing of optometry, and its hard to find information online. I am not asking for medical advice, but rather if this is a feasible change - or - if the doctor may have just made a slip up and put the cylinder/axis on the wrong eye. The sphere seems to match up well and correctly. I have attached the newer (printed) script and the older (hand written) script for comparison. Thanks in advance! ",reddit,0,0
9151," So it's OK if the lenses come in different from what was prescribed because I order them differently. You can't just willy nilly ordered them differently. If the Rx is adjusted for frame fit values then yes. Opticians have been doing this for decades. It has been lost due to the uneducation of the profession. Now it is back into the mainstream with freeform lenses. If a patient is a -12.00 refracted at 13.75mm but the frame they are getting sits as 10mm you can't just order a -12.00, they will be a half diopter over minused. The Rx needs to be ordered as a -11.50 so the patient gets the correct power when wearing the glasses. Adjusting the rest of the Rx for tilt and wrap is just a very much more complicated version of this. ANSI Z80.1-2020 states: . Both uncut and edged finished lenses shall meet the following requirements. For lenses produced with ""as-worn""<U+009D> compensations, the tolerances in clause 5 **apply to those values specified by the supplier of the spectacle component or completed spectacles and not to the prescribed power.** -emphasis is mine. Yes, axis will change depending of frame fit. Axis can change dramatically in the case of sport frames with high tilt and wrap. As I said there is no way for you to know if the axis is off by what OP posted. The ordered axes are 15 and 114. You would need to read the lenses in the lensmeter and compare them to these numbers then apply the ANSI tolerance guidelines. ",reddit,0,0

9153,"The power of your focus is determined by the curvature of your lens and cornea. Astigmatism is when one or both structures (usually the cornea) curves in one direction more than the other (like an egg or football). Therefore, glasses correction must account for different directions instead of assuming all sides curve equally. There is nothing that can be done to prevent astigmatism changes. It's a result of the shape of physical structures in the eyes. It typically stays the same, or very similar, through out life. The exception being towards your 50s or 60s when cataract development causes some changes (which is something else you can't avoid). ",reddit,0,0

I've been doing a lot of reading up on my conditions and was curious about something.

Could this happen? And could this cause any changes in my vision? At first I had an awful time trying to adjust to these glasses, but after several weeks, I've gotten used to them now where everything looks mostly normal and the double vision has mostly cleared up. I went back to see my eye doctor for a checkup on the glasses and my vision is now 20/20 in both eyes with the glasses and she said that my eyes are both perfectly aligned. Still though, I wonder if the glasses are really appropriate for me or if I should talk to my doctor about contacts. So far they've been working perfectly fine except for the slight distortion I have that comes naturally with glasses, but other then that everything else checks out. Should I ask my doctor about contacts? Thanks guys. Edit I'm 28 btw. ",reddit,1,1

If you know of a more appropriate sub, please let me know and I'll post that there. Anyways, I wear contacts since 2017 (give or take) and I never changed my contacts dealer, but now I have been meaning to do some research and figure out if I can't get my contacts for cheaper. So, I searched around and found several websites that sell contacts online, and since I usually never worry about what I put in my eyes (since I always got mine from the same place I get my eyes tested), a bunch of questions popped up, due to ignorance. 1. What materials should I be looking out for? Do I NEED to get silicone hydrogel, or would normal hydrogel suffice? And what is it about the materials like ""Tetrafilcon A"" and such, what are the key differences between them? 2. I found ""yearly"" contact lenses, instead of my usual ""monthly"" ones. I never heard of them, but on paper they seem like the perfect contacts for me, and they are also cheaper in the long run. The lenses in question are Coopervision Kontur 38s. Are they a good idea? 3. Is checking out contacts on a website even trustworthy, or should I just stick with the contacts stores I am already familiar with? (Which seem to be more expensive). 4. Should I even be considering checking for myself what contacts to buy (assuming of course that they match my prescription), or should I just let a professional decide which ones should I take? Sure, this is overall the safest solution, and the one I have been using all this time, but I'm afraid that I might have been taken advantage of pricewise. I think these are all that I got thus far. I would go to ask this to my optometrist, but I wanted to make sure I can get an opinion from someone that isn't trying to sell their product to me. Thanks for the help, in advance! ",reddit,0,0

As far as I was told, my case is not as serious and my vision has been deteriorating so much in past year (I'm still using same glasses from more or less 4 years ago). This is just for context. The first specialist suggested to only perform cross linking on my right eye and then see how the condition progresses on my left eye and decide then. The reason for that is because she said the right eye is a little worse (my sight there is quite bad, while my left eye sight is pretty fine even without glasses). Then covid started and I set aside this topic. And recently I decided to ask for a second opinion, and the second specialist said that the keratoconus is more or less the same on both eyes and the procedure would be to insert intra corneal rings in both eyes and after that perform cross linking. So should I maybe see a third specialist? What are your experiences with intra corneal rings?

I had an eye exam done two months ago and my old and os values didn't actually change but the optometrist did add a cylinder value of 0.25 and an axis value. They never explained what those numbers meant and I didn't check the prescription until months later when I needed to buy new glasses. I learned that this means I have astigmatism but I've never been told I have this from any other doc before. I called my optometrist and just asked to speak with the doctor to clarify what this means and if this was a mistake or not. But they say they don't do any phone calls. Only in person visits and it'll cost me 45 dollars to have this follow up discussion. Does anyone have advice for what I should do here? ",reddit,0,0

9201,It would be a good idea to get checked by your eye doctor. You may need to see a retina specialist based on what your eye doctor says. As we age the vitreous gel inside the eye starts to shrink and you might see floaters or white flashes. Generally that happens with age. I was 49 when I started having that happen. Sometimes it can cause a torn or detached retina. The good news is that a retina specialist can keep it from getting serious by fixing a tear with a laser. I had that and didn't have any problems with it and mine is stable now. ,reddit,0,1

Is this a concern for my overall eye health? I have no history of eye injury, and have 20/15 vision in both eyes. It's not constant, but looking at the sky I can see one every few seconds.

9207,"Also, if your eyes get dry use i-drop by pur, it has no preservatives and it's scleral friendly. I was advised to use the drug store eye lubricants at night and I drop pur in the day while wearing or before putting on my lenses. I don't follow it religiously, I just see how my eye feels. The reason being, your eye is closed and not lubricating while you sleep and it is dry after you wakeup, therefore you hydrate at night so it isn't as dry and in the morning to combat from you not blinking and lubricating your eye all night while you slept. Also, your eye is much more dry in the winter and spring (allergies). the drugstore eye lubricant drops have preservatives and will cause your lens to develop a buildup deposits on the scleral lenses in the long run. If that happens you'll need to send back your lens to your fitter to get it repolished sooner. (my lens fitter advised against the drug store eye drops because they have certain ingredients that cause the lenses to build up proteins/muscous deposits quicker and you will need to polish your lens quicker.) I also get my lenses polished by the cleaner because overtime protein and muscous builds up). My lens fitter has been doing his job for 50 years and he mass produces lenses to opthalmologists and optometrists. He is the manufacturer for most of the businesses in my city. I'm a very advanced case, my opthalmologist sent me to him when she couldn't fit me and he saved my right eye. They were going to give me a transplant for my right eye because my right eye couldn't tolerate rgps. He has a lab and everything, really cool to see. Unfortunately he's really old and I hope he lives forever. You will have to be very mindful of what you put on your face or what gases your near. Hairspray is made of silicones (plastic) and if you spray it while wearing your lenses the silicone binds to your lenses and the whole thing will be garbage and chemically binded. I know this because it happened to me when I was working in hair salons with my lenses. Your lenses are gas permeable and it can absorb stuff. Be wary of perfumes as well. Hot air near stoves. It could also be the fit. It took me around 3-5 months to be fitted correctly. Make sure to also check in with your fitter cause sometimes that could be it too. Hope this helps and hang in there.

It won't stop the progression but it will allow him to get back most if not all his vision.

It is not considered ""refractive surgery"" where the goal is to achieve a specific refractive target or necessarily improve your uncorrected vision. Did you mean to ask about PRK (photorefractive keratectomy)? That is a procedure similar to LASIK without cutting a flap first. There are several experimental protocols combining CXL and PRK with various results. In my opinion, CXL followed by scleral lenses is your safest bet for optimizing your vision at this time.

9227,"You should see an ophthalmologist, preferably a corneal specialist, if you haven't already. I agree that a mild case of KC when you are 32 is less worrisome than it would be if you were younger. But KC is nothing if not unpredictable. While it probably won't get too much worse, there is always the small chance that it will get quite a bit worse. And while it probably won't change too quickly if it does change, there is a small chance that it will change quickly (like in a few months). Your ophthalmologist should provide a plan for managing your KC. That probably should include corneal topography at 3 to 6 month intervals initially and then going to annually if your KC looks stable. If your KC is still progressing at a noticeable rate, corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) will probably be recommended. CXL is highly effective for stopping the progression of KC. If the double vision (monocular diplopia) is bothersome, wearing special contact lenses may reduce or eliminate the double vision and provide better vision than glasses. Find the best lens fitter you can with the experience, resources, and patience needed to fit KC patients. Best wishes for successfully managing your KC. ",reddit,0,1

I spent a lot of time trying different contact lens' and in senior year I had my first cross linking procedure. It didn't improve my vision much, but we were just trying to stop the progression. In college I made it through, but I could feel my eyes getting worse. After graduation I had another cross linking procedure, this time a little more aggressive Epi-off procedure. Only my left eye was a candidate at this time, my right eye wasn't a candidate anymore because the cornea was too thin. I started scleral lens' and this helped me so much! I was comfortable. Overall there were just so many times I would have cornea abrasions and have to take time off of school or work. Until scleral lens' I always felt uncomfortable. I love reading and felt so much frustration that I couldn't easily do it, it was a chore, only when I got scleral lens' I was able to fill on dive into that hobby. I started a book club, I also started studying to go back to school and become a nurse. I have always loved studying and having keratoconus has given my an extra challenge to push through, it's so frustrating that not many people could understand. It made me feel like I was complaining a lot, like I didn't have a right to complain, people wear contacts and it's normal... but with me there was pain, and a grave uncertainty of my future. As a nurse I work 12 hour shifts, and when the pandemic started I picked up extra shifts to help out at the hospital. Long hours strained my eyes, and I started getting corneal abrasions again. Eventually I went to see a cornea specialist because my abrasions persisted and I found out it was actually corneal hydrops in my right eye - I needed a cornea transplant. I remember finding out and getting panic attack in the office, having to numb myself with Xanax when I got home so I could fall asleep. This had always been my fear, what I was trying to always prevent. It made me feel so trapped to this disease. I am still recovering from the transplant. I've been out of work for a month now, I couldn't work with corneal hydrops and now I'm still waiting for clearance to return. I've been really depressed this summer, it's been a hard mental battle. I've had to alter my travel plans, life plans of moving to a new city, and sit in isolation healing because I'm terrified of getting covid during my recovery. This is a pain and a struggle that's hard for most people to understand. Mostly it does unnoticed by other people. I am angry, I am sad, sometimes I am hopeless. However, I know that all I can do is ride the wave. I pray that one day it stabilizes. I pray that this transplant is a positive experience, that it lasts for as long as possible. Day by day, that's how I have to think about it, or else I easily start crying and get overwhelmed. However, I will say keratoconus has never stopped me from pursuing my goals. I have traveled many places and done backpacking trips in South America and Europe. I have studied and pursed academics taking it one day at a time, I think having to sit close to the front of the class to see the board helped me graduate with high honors. I have continued reading even during recovery periods by switching to audiobooks. Driving a car can sometimes be hard when I have periods of complications so I try to live in a city or neighborhood where I can walk to most places, this helps me always keep independence. It's hard, there are definitely moments when I feel so depressed.

It was bad enough that I would stop wearing contacts for years at a time and eventually stopped all makeup, soap, perfume etc. At my wits' end, I eventually searched the internet as to what was wrong with me and Sjogrens fit perfectly. My GP wouldn't refer me to rheumatology until my rh factor was positive AND they received a letter from my optician about it. Even then they didn't want to bother and told me it didn't matter because rheumatology wouldn't be able to do anything. I insisted. Rheumatology said Sjogren's and here we are.

9246,"Dear fellow Redditors, I have just been to two different optomologist who gave me two quite different measurements: \------- The first one: Right eye: -0.25,-1,50, 5 Left eye: -0,5, -3.0, 165 \------- The second one: Right eye: -0.25,-1,50, 5 Left eye: -0.25, -2.0, 165 \------- The second doctor was fully aware of the measurements by the first one. He still set the cylinder to -2.0 as this is my current prescription, and he said it's not worth the trouble to adjust to a different cylinder and that I would never notice the change in real life even if I got used to a higher cylinder. Now I know that my left eye has gotten worse from my current prescription. For example, if I cover my left eye while writing this post I can read it all normally, but if I cover my right eye it's all a blur and I might be able to read a few sentences with a lot of straining and some guesses. The solution here is obvious: I'll go to a third optomologist and just look at my left eye for cylinders in the range of -2.0 to -3.0 and then decide. My condition is that I can read Reddit post with my phone 15-20cm away haha. The other question I have is about lenses. After a bunch of research online, I've pretty much settled on Hoya. The safest option is Nulux identity V+, either 1.6 or 1.67 cut (I don't really see the need for the 1.67). Now my only worry is that I'm a computational physicist which means I spend around 9 hours a day behind a computer. So the Hoya Sync seems quite attractive. The only problem is that I don't know how the lens will react, as I use a PC most of the time, with the screen around 40cm from my face and completely leveled with my hight (I look at it directly through the center of the lens) unless I move my eyes to the corners of the screen, but then I have no idea how the lens will react. When I'm not using the PC I use my laptop holding it in my lap, so I'm definitely looking down (around the 30-40cm) from my eyes, or I use my phone again definitely looking down around 10-15cm from my eye. Now I really don't know what to do here. If I go with the V+ nothing can go wrong... But if I pick the sync lenses, my eyes can get massive relaxation, or my vision gets really screwed. Any comment/opinion appreciated (even different lens recommendations) Thank you all for your time. Sincerely, Kevin. ",reddit,0,0

Anyway, I never had them, or rather, I only had this pain in the eye that I never personally linked to sinus problems. I am 31 and never been diagnosed with sinusitis. Being the pain located in the eye, I kept visiting ophtalmologists that kept saying that all was OK, only the last one asked to have an MRI done which showed nothing stricly eye-related, but this ethmoidal cyst. So he referred me to an ENT surgeon that offered removal, but he didn't seem entirely sure that this is actually causing my pain. He didn't mention sinusitis either. He said that those cyst in this location can indeed sometime cause orbital pain and headache but, given my history of strabismus surgery (which involves cutting of muscles and, possibly, small nerves in them) he cannot guarantee that there isn't something else going on in my case. So I am bouncing between ENT and opthalmologist without having a clear answer. The cyst is there so I think I will have it removed, he didn't offered any medical treatments prior to surgery.

9262,"Most likely thing you have is dry eyes. Focused activity line computer work, tv, driving, reading... all contribute to dry eye because your brain forgets to blink. This allows the surface of the eye to dry out and become irregular. This is what causes the blurry vision. I'd recommend a few things. First, use artificial tears on a regular basis 4 times per day, even if you don't think you need it. This will help keep the surface regular. Second is to use the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break by looking 20 feet away. This helps break up your tasks and reminds you to blink. The recent quarantine with increased computer time (and decreased sleep) have likely made it worse. As far as amblyopia (sounds like this is what you're describing as your right eye not seeing as well as your left), there is likely little more that can be done to improve the blurry vision. Amblyopia is a poor communication between the eye and the brain. The eyes have to learn how to talk to the brain when you're a child. There are many things that can cause poor communication between the eye and the brain (i.e. different glasses prescription between the eyes, one eye having more astigmatism than the other, cataract in one eye, eyelid drooping in one eye...). If this isn't corrected, the brain and eye lose the ability to learn how to communicate and that blur becomes permanent. Kids who wear patches are being treated for amblyopia by covering their good eye and forcing their bad eye to learn that communication. After the age of about 12-16, that period that the eye and brain can learn to talk is mostly over. There are some studies showing there may be some benefit to amblyopia treatment in certain types of people up into their mid teens (usually people who've never had any amblyopia treatment, and the later the amblyopia treatment starts, the less improvement can be expected). LASIK doesn't affect amblyopia. You can think of LASIK as getting your glasses prescription lasered into your cornea. It can't sharpen the vision in the amblyopic eye because the communication from eye to brain simply isn't there. Another way to think about it is the eye being a camera that is connected to a computer via a cable. The cable is the optic nerve and the computer is the brain. Amblyopia causes a problem in the computer itself. So everything else in the system looks normal but it still produces a blurry picture. You could put glasses or contacts on the camera, you could even do lasik on the camera, but there's still a processing problem causing the blurry vision. It doesn't mean you can't have LASIK but it does mean your bear vision after the procedure is still limited. ",reddit,0,0

However, I highly recommend protecting your teeth now in case you do develop dry mouth. For me, my dry mouth started young - around age 6 - and was so slow to develop over time. I never really thought I had dry mouth - it was just the way it was for me - I thought I was like everyone else. I got diagnosed at age 26 after years and years of dental issues that I might have been able to slow down. Today, I use an electric toothbrush, I brush at least twice a day, I floss, and I use a high fluoride toothpaste at night (it's prescription only - you don't rinse after it). You can also use a fluoride mouthwash at night - I mix it up depending on how I feel. I also always get the fluoride treatment at the dentist. My dentist is also sweet enough to send me home with an extra fluoride treatment for me to do in between visits. I have had so many cavities worked on and have needed to have two teeth pulled.

9284,"Since this post might be a little long I put a TLDR at the bottom. Some background: I have a really high prescription (10). I am in college away from home, so two weeks ago I went to an ophthalmologist to get a dilated exam to check on my retinas and get my yearly checkup. I wanted to get this appointment specifically with an ophthalmologist rather than an optometrist since I haven't noticed a significant change in vision (prescription wise) and since its been a few years since I was dilated. My last appointment before lockdown only did some imaging tests (I think an OCT), and I remember I wasn't dilated. I am well aware of the risks of my high prescription and know the general symptoms to look out for (new floaters, flashes, dark curtain) if I need to drop everything and see an eye doctor. I have had floaters since I was 12. Now here goes - I get flashes in the exact same spots, in both eyes, when I move them rapidly, particularly against bright white backgrounds. I was under the impression that flashes due to tears/detachments happen regardless of eye movement, and they are usually severe and apparent. I didn't know what I was seeing was ""flashes"" until I moved my eyes rapidly with the intent of seeing them, and compared this to a what I've been reading. Well, now I can't UN-see them. I notice them much more often now, but still ONLY with rapid eye movements in bright settings. This was a major reason for the appointment. I am fairly certain I have been ""seeing"" these flashes for a few years. Anyhow, here's how the appointment went. He did the visual tests for my prescription and only raised my prescription up a touch (after a ~~little~~ scare as I had never seen plus cylinder notation before), which was a little bit of a relief suggesting my prescription might be starting to stable out. I talked to him about the flashes, so he dilated my eyes, used a slit lamp, and in a separate test I remember him looking around in my eye, having me look all the way up, left, right, down, through a handheld bright light. He said my retina looked healthy, and that the flashes are likely due to the vitreous fluid tugging on my retina, which can be triggered by the rapid eye movement. He gave me my new prescription and sent me on my way. I lurk here and on similar subreddits, and have read some comments about the how direct ophthalmoscopy is limited in observing the periphery, versus say indirect ophthalmoscopy. I've also read some scare stories about tests like this missing tears in the far periphery which then progress into detachments. Which, of course, gets me concerned. I am planning on getting another appointment with my regular optometrist when I get back home in a month anyway. So, my questions are: Is direct ophthalmoscopy typically sufficient for identifying tears, holes, or the like? I know indirect ophthalmoscopy is generally better. Is it urgent that I find a new appointment immediately with another eye doctor in town and get a more thorough test, or should I keep the one I have in a month? When I have my new appointment, what kinds of tests, if any, should I ask for? Specific imaging? Sorry about the length, and I apologize if questions like this aren't appropriate on this subreddit, but thank you for your help. TLDR: High prescription. Seen flashes for a few years. Went to see an ophthalmologist very recently. Doctor said I'm fine and attributed them to vitreous. Is direct ophthalmoscopy sufficient in finding tears, and would it behoove me to get a second opinion urgently vs in a month? ",reddit,0,0
9285,I had to have one last July (was 22) its a transplant so there can always be complications but as long as you take care of it after you should be fine. (You do feel like shit for the first few days after) The only shitty part was not being able to use my rgp lense in my left eye for the past year while its healed so its annoying to predominantly use one eye to drive and stuff but as long as your positive and proactive in youre eye care then the chances of any complications should be minimal.

No other eye doctor has mentioned it to me. Maybe they didn't think it was worth mentioning? Could it have been caused by trauma? I've had some corneal abrasions and recently was punched in the eye by my baby's head. Went to the doc for that, said my eye was fine... could the cataract possibly not been formed yet and now it is? Could being punched in the eye by my baby's head cause a cataract? I even asked the doctor if it was blunt force trauma when my eye got punched by my baby's head, he said no. The doctor I saw today said it could be genetics. He also said he didn't think I needed the surgery right now and just acted like it wasn't much of anything.

9289,"1.67 and 1.74 have nearly the same Abbe value (about 32-33), so unfortunately the amount of chromatic aberration will be the same. Your best bet are lenses with high Abbe values (the higher the value, the less chromatic aberration). CR-39 and Crown glass are your best bet.. but the lenses will be thicker. To reduce thickness with these lenses, it would be best for you to change frames. You need a frame as small and circular as possible, with your pupil at the center of the frame eyewire. This will reduce the amount of thickness at the sides of the lenses. ",reddit,0,0

9299,"Hello, I am no eye professional so take what I say with a grain of salt . I was diagnosed with the same thing as you, which judging on your prescription of plus is hyperopia. The doctor told me as well to use glasses, despite the fact of me telling the doc I could see just fine without them. Nonetheless I went and got glasses. Same prescription as you +0.50 on both eyes with very little astigmatism on the left eye instead the right like yours. I tried to wear them whenever I was doing close up work and the glasses were very uncomfortable , they told me it was normal it was the adjusting period so I would wear them for that. However I noticed that my eyes just couldn't stand the glasses and rejected them heavily (this is somewhat common with hyperopes i have heard). However I still wore them and it never improved, so I stopped wearing them. I went for a second opinion and the other doctor didn't find anything. Now I'm going for a 3rd and final opinion. From my experience and from what I have heard ,a +0.50 is a very small prescription that rarely needs glasses full time due to the accommodation muscles in your eyes( like I said no professional so take it with a grain of salt). With time though from what I have seen of other hyperopes, it does get worse but its a slow progression that happens in years. When you hit your 40s you will probably lose your far sight as presbyopia kicks in, this is very normal though most people get this at that age. The downside of this is that there's barely any research for hyperopia as there is for myopia so the treatments aren't the best. The upside is that it is a slower progression than myopia, (some times). ",reddit,0,0

Dominant eye to see distance, other eye to see near. Or you can always opt for early cataract surgery. Cataracts are your lenses that have hardened/grown in density (which is the reason why people need readers at age 40). When you undergo cataract surgery, a synthetic lens is inserted in your eyes, and basically you can get bifocal lenses implanted (so you have permanent bifocals in your vision to put it simply.

After i got back from a study abroad program in London, where i had an accident, broke my nose during a basketball game, i got a little bit depressed from this accident and started smoking weed and also using visine almost every day to get rid of bloodshot eyes. I visited the local optometrist and i was told by her that my pressure was around 25/26 at the time (puff test). At the time i ignored it and thought something was wrong with the machine. Fast forward 5 years later to the present point i go to optometrist and was told that my pressure was 26/27 and 24/25 another time. I got sent to a glaucoma specialist where after several tests i was told the puff pressure test overestimates my pressure since i have a thick cornea and after they did a golden standard eye pressure test it ended up being 20/23. I was told everything in my eyes looks healthy after they performed other glaucoma suspect testing. I was there for a good 2 hours doing a bunch of glaucoma tests.

I'm a teacher, and have always spent part of my day in front of a computer, but with Covid it became all day. My right eye always seemed to be worse (which is why all the pictures below are of my right eye) and that is pretty status quo. If I'm having ear problems, my right ear is always the worst. I have intermittent pain in my right shoulder that I used to assume was some arthritis/inflammation from playing drums, but it seems to come and go in conjunction with my right ear and/or right eye inflammation. There are linked pictures below. It probably started closer to February but March is the earliest picture I kept. So around the end of May, I had both eye inflammation and ear inflammation. My right ear felt like it was being stabbed periodically, and my eyes had developed light sensitivity. (The May 31st picture). I figured a sinus infection with maybe an eye infection as well. Also had a UTI. No sinus pressure, though. Went to Urgent Care. He said he didn't think the eyes were infected, but figured the inflammation was due to a sinus infection. Gave me steroids and antibiotics. I stopped wearing contacts (actually stopped a few days before that). The eyes seemed to do well with the steroids and glasses. Once the steroids were done after five days, I tried contacts again (brand new pair) and regretted it within a few hours. Went to an optometrist and she said they were infected. Gave me antibiotics and steroid eyedrops. No contact usage. After a week I went for a checkup and they recommended I taper off the eyedrops and could start wearing contacts again once I got to two drops a day. I waited until I completely finished tapering off the drops. That was about two or so weeks ago. I used to wear them about 14 - 16 hours a day. I'd take them off at night and switch to glasses when I watched TV/played video games and then wouldn't use them until I left for work the next day. Now, since the infection, I actually wear them as little as possible. Maybe 6-7 hours a day or less. Mainly when I go out, because I hate how I look with my glasses. They're like... coke bottle thick. I never slept overnight with them. I do periodically fall asleep in them for an hour or so. Never swim in them/shower in them.

My thought process is either CLI (which would suck) or maybe I have developed a sensitivity to the solution. I remember a period about 7 or 8 years ago when I switched to a sensitive solution because I thought maybe my eyes were getting irritated by the solution (not this bad, though). After about a year, I told my optometrist about it in a yearly checkup and he basically told me that was dumb and I needed to switch back. So I did. Didn't really have any issues after that until now. Should I try the sensitive solution first? I can't easily hit up my optometrist for another few weeks due to scheduling, but can move stuff around if it is more serious. Thanks in advance. ",reddit,0,0

9326,"Hi everyone! I've known that I have had a lazy eye since I was a really young kid. I wore glasses/tried patching when I was in elementary school. Eventually, I just wore glasses partway through middle school but stopped wearing them because my non-lazy eye could see fine (and I hated wearing glasses cause I thought they made me look nerdy, all dumb middle school stuff). I'm now in my mid-20's and recently decided to get a pair of glasses again just to wear around the house and at work. A few days ago I went for an eye exam so I could get an updated prescription (I probably haven't been to the eye doctor in 10+ years). The doctor prescribed me a ""plano"" lense on my lazy eye. My other eye is -0.5. I'm just wondering if anyone has had any experience like this before, or if this is normal? When I did wear glasses, the lense on my lazy eye was always very thick and people would point it out to me a lot, so it feels weird for my prescription now to be essentially just a plain lense with no correction on that eye. I'm definitely not doubting my optometrist's work. I'm just curious if this is a normal thing and if someone could explain it to me a little more. ",reddit,0,0

9328,"I was diagnosed 5 months ago on routine checkup, I did not even realize I had anything wrong with my eyes. In reality I couldn't even read a screen with my right eye (with glasses on). My Opthamologist said since I'm 30 and not 16 , progression could've stopped. He also said hes more of a cornea transplant proponent over laser surgeries so I should just come back in 6 months for a follow up. Since then I have read all about CXL and how it's the only way to stop progression besides posisbly by age. I read about ghosting and astigmatisms here too but since I did not have those symptoms and I'm 30 I figured maybe it would stop on its own. I also figured either way I was going to need special lenses to see better out of my right eye. I felt no rush to stop progression with a scary Laser surgery. **What I didn't realize was my sight would get so bad I would NEED contact lenses to read everything, even my cell phone.** Until recently I could always read things like my texts or books without glasses but now I get really bad ghosting so now I cant see near or far.. What truly is alarming is how bad this ghosting progressed in a manner of weeks. I know my right eye has been much weaker than my left eye for over 3 years so I feel like ive had it that long. The scary thing is, it has only taken 2 months for me to not be able to read close screens. **I believe it has to do with stronger prescription sunglasses given to me by the same Dr.** after I was diagnosed. What frustrates me the most is he even said I wouldnt even suggest stronger prescription glasses because it might mess with your brain. I respected that but I then needed an updated prescription to get sunglasses. Even if I needed lenses, I needed something to help me see till then. I explained in an email that although he suggested not increasing it I still needed a newly signed one even if it was my old prescription, but he gave me the stronger one. I kind of noticed that whenever I used my sunglasses it got worse but now i'm sure after a sunny week, my ghosting has been worse than ever. Sorry for the tangent but I think it needs to be explained better in this subreddit. If you arent experiencing ghosting yet, maybe try to beat it. **I didn't realize it can get to a point where you Always need your contacts to read , in a manner of weeks.** So if you can still read your cellphone without contact lenses, maybe try to be proactive and visit many doctors. Now I think I might never be able to read well without contacts IN and that might make a huge difference in quality of life.

9338,"Ophthalmologist here. First, let me say that no licensed medical practitioner is going to give a pregnant woman medical advice over the internet--the potential medicolegal exposure is simply too great. So bearing in mind that I'm speaking in general terms, and am neither rendering a diagnosis nor making recommendations to you: Brief flashing lights in the periphery of one eye are a classic manifestation of *vitreoretinal traction*, a condition wherein the jelly inside the back of the eye (the *vitreous*) is tugging on the neurosensory retina, usually in a far-peripheral location. The physical stimulation imparted to the retina by the tugging stimulates the photoreceptors, which do what photoreceptors do--they send a signal back to the brain, which interprets that signal as light flashes. By far, the #1 risk factor for VR traction is age. Eyes 60 or so undergo changes that can lead to VR traction. In younger adults, severe diabetic retinopathy is probably the most common cause. High myopia (in the -10D range) is a risk factor in young adults as well, as is a history of significant ocular trauma. Is there a relationship between VR traction and pregnancy? Tangentially, yes. As mentioned, severe diabetic retinopathy can produce it. Because pregnancy can accelerate diabetes, it is not unheard of for diabetic mothers to experience a significant worsening of diabetic retinopathy that culminates in VR traction. (That said: If a pregnant woman is getting good prenatal care and has never tested positive for diabetes, in the latter stages of pregnancy she is **not** going to suddenly get diabetes so bad that she develops VR traction.)

Now I understand there are different types of eye implants and different types eye/vision impairments so experiences will vary, but I've noticed that articles I've read on the internet about 1-2 years ago with a colleague of mine (we were researching new markets) either no longer exist and some testimonials and interviews with people who had horrible experiences can no longer be found? I don't have a source nor do I remember all of the research word for word, but the jist of one was 4 of the 5 (this number could be wrong) test patients after 24 hours experienced great discomfort and intense nightmare/lucid dreaming. Some felt extremely off balance, experiencing vertigo like symptoms and dizziness. Headachesr and migraines were also common. Another interesting note was that the patients preferred to use their eyes only when stationary, close their eyes when moving and look again once stopped. Other patients outside of this test group also shared similar experiences. When researching this stuff back then I wasn't even doing a deep dive into google, maybe three pages in max, now I can't find anything anywhere.

Actually, she just said we will look at the TearCare after the set of 4 IPL is complete in 4 months and discounted the value of meibomian gland probing talking about the downsides of that procedure. Yes, I looked at the images taken from the meibomian glands the day of our visit and she pointed out the strengths and weaknesses in them. Actually it looks better than the ones I did with the other doctor 5 years ago. She also plucked 4 eyelashes in several areas putting them under a microscope saying as she looked in front of me that the demodex did not look too bad. Might have been some improvement from the efforts so far with the glans and the demodex. I have read that Lipiflow does sometimes show improvement in getting some of the glands moving again that were not before. I will see about it next week on the expression aspect since the first session is next Tuesday. I have been operating on the assumption that I want to arrest the further deterioration in the glands and if possible reverse the damage thus I am erring in the direction of too much. Additionally, the other assumption I have is to prevent the next flare-up that might occur instead of waiting for the next flare up to happen then react. My doctor #2 does her eyes with Lipiflow every year and she is in her mid to late thirties I figure. My doctor #1 has been asking me if I thought Lipiflow works as she is considering doing it!

I suspect her colleague was quoting me a shorter time frame to close the sale. To make matters worse, finding a frame was extremely difficult. I'm not sure why but all the stores kept telling me they had very few metal frames with spring hinges and the ones that did were expensive $200+ frames which was outside my price range. When I gave up and chose a frame without spring hinges, I was warned that it was too narrow for me and it would be uncomfortable at the temples.

9368,"Hey all, just stopped by with a question. I recently had to get new glasses and I feel like I may have gotten a wrong prescription? There's a couple caveats though. I had been wearing the same pair of glasses for the past 7 years (yes, dumb I know. I'm lazy and it didn't bother me.) But they recently broke, so I had to go get an eye exam and a new pair. I got the new pair and everything looks clear, but there's something... off about them. Everything looks farther away and smaller which I never experienced before. Could the doctor have gotten my prescription wrong? Or are my eyes just taking a while to adjust to the new script? I found the results for an unrelated eye exam I took in Dec 2018. I know nothing about eyes, but based on 3 years it seems like a big differences in their results? Here's a picture from both exams. Top results are from 12-26-18 exam. Bottom results are from exam last week. Could my prescription changed that much in under 3 years?

I have never suffered any physical injury to my eye, I'm just severely myopic. In 2014, I had a tear in my left retina which was temporarily confined with laser photocoagulation. In 2017, this developed into a retinal detachment with multiple breaks. I had another round of laser treatment that was unsuccessful, and then emergency surgery with a vitrectomy, endolaser treatment, scleral buckles, and a pneumatic retinopexy (according to my medical record). I lost some vision and a good bit of depth-perception from the detachment, but otherwise, I have healed completely. All further appointments with my opthalmologist in the years that have followed have been without issue. My most recent check-up was this past February. I understand that because of my myopia and background of previous issues I may be susceptible to further problems, but I am wondering if I should allow this to continue to limit my activities? My hand-eye coordination isn't as good as it used to be, but I still would like to get back to playing sports.

9398,"Hi guys, My RX hasn't changed in the last 9 years. I had always worn contact lenses, but in the last year had to start wearing glasses more frequently due to my eyes drying out/disorientation and extreme tiredness with the contacts in. I had the same pair for those 9 years (again, rarely wore them). The style is dated and the lenses are scratched, so after my optometry appt, I ordered a new pair. My old frames were plastic, rectangular and the lenses fairly thick (-4.75 and -5.0), but not heavy or noticeable to others. These were very comfortable for me. I received my new pair and can't wear them due to disorientation and distortion. I will also see an entire lampshade (if the light is on )in the corner of my glasses, when the light isn't in my peripheral vision. The lenses are thinner and less curved as well. This optometrist changed my axis from 110 to 134, despite me being told my mild astigmatism would have the same numbers (this was a new optometrist). Not sure if that's an issue. These lenses also have nose pads and thus sit farther from my eyes, which I also dislike. The lenses are also much thinner (polycarbonate) and much less curved (my old glasses almost wrap around the outer corners of my eyes , which seems to help). They are also not as wide as my rectangular glasses, so perhaps this is part of the issue. I'm fine with these lenses as long as I don't turn my head or my eyes. Once I do that, it's a dizzying mess. I'm trying to get the same lenses I had before, because while they aren't thin, they're comfortable and the way they look on me doesn't cause me to look bug eyed etc. Any suggestions on what to look for? All I seem to be able to find available with my RX are polycarbonate/high index. I honestly don't know what my old lenses are made from (definitely not glass. I'm leaning towards regular plastic) and without seeing anything else as an option anywhere, I'm a little concerned. Thank you and pardon my ignorance. Nearly 10 yrs behind on lens updates, I guess I should've been updating my frames more often. ",reddit,0,0

High Index lenses are thinnest at the center, so the thickest part will be at the lens edges.

Wearing glasses that are too strong as a child can theoretically worsen myopic progression.

9427,"Oh man hope I'm not too late to advise... believe it or not Optometrists usually give rubbish advice when it comes to lens choices. The Tailor made lenses were the priciest varifocals until the recent release of Superdigital AND Superdrive. I will explain this as simply as possible, with all varifocals you have distance vision zone at the top then working down the lens you have computer vision zone (usually arms length) and then near vision zone at the bottom. The more you pay for the varifocal, the less distortion there is on the edges meaning wider field of vision. Superdigital is a new lens that introduces a 4th vision zone between the computer and near zone called ""Digital"" which is designed for when we usually hold phones and tablets etc at around 20-40 cm. From what you have said so far, I actually wouldn't recommend varifocals for your prolonged computer use and would recommend either VDU or occupational lenses.

Your doctor should be able to test for them.

Don't use those more than every 4-6 hours. You can absolutely go to town on the ones I linked. I sure did. I was probably putting them in every 30 minutes at one point.

The Acuvue on the other hand gives me fantastic vision all day, but the first few minutes after putting them in are rough. First of all, the solution that the dailies are in seem to make my eyes burn a bit. Then the lenses themselves seem to scratch and irritate my eyes to the point where I sometimes have to sit in the dark with my eyes closed for 2 minutes because I can't keep them open. After a few minutes things seem fine and then I have zero problems all day with crystal clear vision and I forget they're even there. I'm just trying to figure out why this initial irritation is happening and if I'm doing anything wrong. I mentioned it to the assistant but she just said I can rinse the Acuvue in my bottled solution first if I want, which seems to help a little.

9446,"The question has already been answered but just to add a little detail: There is no number at which you become blind once you hit it. Optometry is part physics part health care. Glasses correction is the physics part of it. As long as there is a focal point on your retina, and as long as the path to it is clear, and as long as the signal can reach your brain from your eyes, it is possible to correct it with glasses. If you are hypermetropic, plus powered, there is a limit to how high a power you will need because the eyeball is only so long. I'm not saying there's a limit to how high we can correct, rather I'm saying there's a limit to how high we'll ever need to correct. So you don't really see people with plus power that goes that high. If you are myopic, negative power, the number needed can get much higher to correct your vision. I've seen as high as -29, and I'm sure others have seen higher. It definitely is a little more difficult to correct vision that high, partially because the higher your correction needs to get the less likely to doctor will have the lenses on hand to neutralize it in an exam. But also because the higher your prescription gets, the more likely other factors such as minification and vertex distance will have a significant impact on your correction. But it is still possible to correct vision that high. As I said as long as there is a focal point and there's a clear path to it and their is signal to the brain then you can correct it with glasses. Some diseases, like cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, corneal scarring, and others cause the clear tissues that let light into the eye to become cloudy or opaque. Because light can't pass through, no matter how strong or weak your glasses are, that would be considered blindness. Other diseases, like macular degeneration or retina detachment, causes the focal point to be ""crumpled up"" for lack of a better word. That can also cause blindness. And yet other diseases, such as stroke, glaucoma, brain tumors, can affect the optic nerve which connects your eyes to your brain. In this case there's nothing wrong with the eyes but you're still blind because the brain gets no signal. High prescriptions are associated with higher risk of eye diseases. So it's definitely true that if you have a really high prescription you are more likely to go blind, but there's no amount of prescription that guarantees you to go blind. And overall the average risk to any single person of going blind is pretty low And can usually be avoided with routine eye exams. ",reddit,0,0

She has experienced many of the issues related to these diseases (debilitating fatigue, arthritis, pericarditis, pleuritis, scleritis, severe sicca symtoms with multiple corneal abrasions, deep vein thrombosis and many more). She works full time as a teacher. We live in Norway. I've just rambled down some of the things that are at the top of my head ... **Offload energy thieves** By this I mean do stuff for her that might seem like small things but which can steal energy. Even though your wife doesn't suffer from debilitating fatigue removing some energy thieves probably won't hurt :) \- One of the things I do for my wife is act as a secretary when it comes to doctor's appointments and medications. She asked me early on if this was something I could do for her and it has worked out well. I keep in touch with PCP, rheumatologist, opthalmologist and whoever else needs to be kept in touch with. This is of course something **she** initiated with the different doctors so I can act on her behalf. \- I also make sure she always has enough of her medicines and fill her multi dose blister pack without her needing to worry about it. \- I get up with the kid every morning (he likes to get up around 5-5:30) so she can sleep until 6:30 on weekdays or as long as she wants in the weekends. \- Since I'm up before her every day I make sure her Blephasteam goggles ([https://www.thea-pharmaceuticals.co.uk/products/blephasteam](https://www.thea-pharmaceuticals.co.uk/products/blephasteam)) are ready when she gets up and I try to have breakfast ready. and so on.

9463,"1. Prison for 5 years. Previously self-owned practice for 5 years. 2. Depends wildly on location (rural better), practice type (group or OMD often better), client base (rich better), etc. Sometimes will increase; sometimes will stagnate. If you work for someone, they're unlikely to give you a lot more money each year for no reason. 3. Cities: often have to work part-time in multiple locations. More rural: easier to find single practice. Start making connections and try to find a practice you are interested in before you graduate (although some classmates' plans fell through, which sucks). 4. I never specialized, so dunno. 5. Probably. Unless I could have invested a ton into Bitcoin. 6. Specialize. Glaucoma and diabetes, maybe some macular degeneration. Dry eye. Specialty contact lenses. Pediatrics / vision therapy. Low vision. 7. Not particularly. Will probably approximately grow with the rest of the economy. Although online sales might hurt optical and computerized testing might hurt medical. 8. Depends on what your comparison is. If you see mainly Medicaid patients, a vision plan patient is gold (well, depending on how well Medicaid reimburses; some states it's quite good). If you see mainly rich private-pay patients at $500 an exam, a vision plan patient is crap. 9. Matching what you enjoy about the job to what will get you paid. 10. About the same; things aren't really changing that fast in general. Even with online stuff, most people still like choosing glasses in person. 11. Depends on where you are and what types of connections you set up in school. Planned with the owners of a private practice during your second and third years of optometry to come in as an associate and buy your way into ownership across 5-10 years in a smaller city in a middle-of-nowhere state?

9464,"Hi, I had a posterior vitreous detachment at the age of 25, which resulted in having an epiretinal membrane as well. It never caused me any issues and was only spotted by the optometrist at a regular eye check. I realized later that a black dot floater I was seeing was probably this. I hardly ever noticed it though. However, I'm 35 years old now, and I've just had another posterior vitreous detachment which I don't think has fully detached yet as the jelly is flashing every time I blink. I don't mind too much if I get an eye floater, I can live with that, but I'm getting anxious knowing that I could keep getting many more PVD's throughout my life and knowing that every time it occurs, there is a risk of a retinal tear or detachment. I know its been 10 years since my last one, but I'm guessing it could become more regular as I get older. I don't have myopia and have never understood why I started getting these so early on.

Caucasian female, 45, near-sighted with astigmatism, regular soft contact lens wearer. For the last several years, there have been times when I was wearing my prescription eye glasses (like if I was cleaning my contact lenses overnight or taking a ""day off"" from wearing them), when I would get a surge of searing pressure-like pain just where my glasses touch my skull above and behind my ears. If I didn't snatch the glasses off my face right away, the pain would intensify and sort of wrap around my skull! And the second I did snatch the glasses off, the pain would quickly fade away and vanish. This continued even after I changed my prescription and got new glasses. Neither pair of glasses is too tight; one pair is actually way too big and barely touches at all, but even the slightest touch can cause the pain. But here's the kicker: it can happen even if my eyes are closed as I put the glasses on and take them off! So I don't think it's a vision thing at all... I think it's some sort of physical pressure point thing, like fibromyalgia, but just in this one very specific spot.

9469,"I'm going to try to keep this as brief and relevant as possible, but so far there is a lot to cover. I will try to keep it chronological as well. **January 2010 (17 years of age)** \- optic nerve ""swelling"" noticed on routine exam. MRI done to rule out IIH. MRI was normal, more images taken. Optic disc drusen diagnosed in right eye only. At the time, they were ""buried"" drusen and were not considered significant. Told at the time to monitor yearly by doing a visual field test at each eye exam and self-monitor for changes in color vision. **2010 - 2019** \- I do mostly yearly visits, give or take some months, and receive normal results on my tests. Periodic imaging it taken and drusen is still, as far as anyone told me, normal and not significant. My most recent imaging and test were 2019, which as far as I am aware were normal. Color vision is normal. **2020** \- testing is skipped this year for obvious reasons **Early/mid July 2021 (29 years of age)** \- I start to notice in early July that the vision in my right eye seems off, but not in terms of distance. I cannot quite put my finger on what is off about it, just noted I cannot see as well. In mid-July, I realize that I am not able to see as well in my peripheral vision in the upper nasal portion. I self-test for difference in color vision between two eyes and notice that I am seeing everything in a significantly more warm/orange tone in my right eye than with my left. I call and make an appointment with a new ophthalmologist. **Late July 2021** \- At the new doctor, lots of imaging is done as well as a Humphrey visual field test. The images showing the optic nerve head showed ""very significant"" drusen in the right eye and only a small amount on the left. He estimated that due to how much there is, it is contributing to the loss of peripheral vision to a degree. One of the images (I don't know the name but [this is the type](https://ibb.co/NVLZVdN) of image) showed a lumpy/bumpy appearance, which I understand to be normal with my level of drusen. It shows what looks like some fluid on the right one, which he notes but doesn't think is important. The visual field test showed a significant amount of visual field loss on the nasal side. My last visual field test from 2019 was faxed over from my previous doctor and was completely normal. Due to the progression and the sudden nature of my vision loss, he referred me to a neuroophthalmologist. **Late August 2021** \- I have the appointment with the neuro. More imaging is done as well as another Humphrey visual field test. The imaging returns the same results, but the visual field test showed slight improvement, though my vision was still affected to a degree. My IOP was 23, but my corneas are quite thick, so when adjusting for that it would have been around an 18. She did not believe that there was anything neurological going on and that it is likely loss from the drusen. She think it could potentially be from migraines and suggests an MRI if I'm worried, but she doesn't think one is necessary. I decline an MRI at that time because if she isn't worried, I'm not worried. We make a follow-up appointment for late November to check my visual field again and note any changes or worsening symptoms. **Late August - early October 2021** \- My vision stays about the same for a week or two, but then gets significantly worse. I have tunnel vision in the right eye all day, accompanied by sharp, stabbing pain in the eye. My vision is also now blurred. I notice occasional pain/pressure in the eye as well. The next day, my vision is back to my normal. There is no clear pattern happening, but I have days where my vision is ""normal"" and other days where it's not. I almost immediately start keeping track of symptoms and activities to find any correlation. I make an appointment with me regular eye doctor just to update my prescription, as I believed it had changed and with everything else, that got put to the side at the time. In late August, I cut out caffeine and stopped taking my prescribed Adderall to see if there would by any improvement in symptoms. **Today** \- I go in for my normal eye exam. My prescription is exactly the same, though I mention my symptoms to him, and mentioned today was a ""good vision"" day. He decides to do more imaging, though doesn't really mention why, and takes my IOP which was 22. The imaging shows a choroidal nevus in the right eye, as well as a CHRPE. He mentions that with the symptoms and the fluctuations I've reported, he believes that I should go ahead and have the MRI. He also says that it's possible that the nevus is leaking fluid, which can cause vision loss as well. He does not think that it is being caused by migraines as the other doc suggested. He encourages me to reach out to my neuro doc to see if she can see me any earlier than November 30th and asks that I update him if possible. I reach out via the messaging system and hear back fairly quickly. She does not think an MRI is necessary, but she is willing to order one if I want. She says that it's incredibly unlikely for my nevus to be causing any issues or leaking fluid. She now believes that my vision problems are caused by a combination of ocular migraines and the drusen. She recommends I cut back on caffeine and switch to a different ADHD medication. I have already completely stopped both of those things as of late August. She recommends I start keeping a log of my symptoms and recording my stress levels, caffeine intake, sleep amount and quality, and any high-sodium/high-MSG, dairy, and sugar intake. I write back to let her know that I had cut out caffeine/stimulants all together, and that I had been keeping track of sleeping patterns and quality and found no correlation. I also let her know I have never had any known issues with ocular migraines in the past and asked if it was normal for them to start quite suddenly. She wrote back and mentioned that she still believes it's highly likely to be ocular migraines, and asks me to keep track of the other items as well. She said it's not unheard of for these to begin suddenly. She mentions she will still see me as scheduled on November 30th, but doesn't believe it is neurological in nature and I will likely need to follow up with my regular doc or my PCP. I reach out to my regular doc to let him know that she believes it to be due to migraines and not something neurological, and give him the updates. He says he disagree entirely, and wants me to either reach out to the other doctor in the department or get a second opinion from a different referral. (I should mention, this is not costing me anything to get the MRI or see another doctor, as I've already met my deductible for the year, so both are very doable). At this point, I am really quite unclear about what's causing this or where to go from here. One doc recommends an MRI, one is saying it's not needed but she'll order one if I really want her to. One is telling me it really doesn't seem like migraines, the other is telling me that's probably what it is. I'm inclined to go with whatever the neuro says, as with that being her specialty, it seems she would be more likely to know what to do. However, I am hesitant to think that this is just migraines being caused by something like MSG or sugar or some other life factor that I've been exposed to my entre life when I have never had any issues like this before. I am really at a loss for what to do from here. ",reddit,1,1

9482,Does a millimeter or two more of optical zone increase the overall size of the IOL by very much? This is a good question. I'm not qualified to do more than guess at it though. The high power lenses (like SN60WF 29 D) already require a larger incision because of their thickness. I imagine the overall thickness centrally will continue to increase as the diameter increases. Then we run into folding issues if the optic is larger. Also how do you compensate for the haptics? Make them smaller? They might become weaker. Now you might mess with centration. This would require a whole lot of R and D and $$$ on top of the FDA approval process. And it's a big risk - what if after everything there's no significant reduction in side effects? Again just not worth the risk given the low incidence of complaints in the first place. ,reddit,0,0

About 2 months ago when I was wearing monthly contacts, I noticed I had these two redspots in my right and left eye that didn't look quite right. There was no pain or anything. Maybe the ocassional itch. This was after 4 months of wearing the contacts with no issues. Of note, the week before this happened I did overwear my contacts - some days for 12/13 hours. I also work in IT so I'm at a computer most of the day. Eventually, the redness seemed to be isolated to just my right eye when I put in contacts. Left eye was totally fine with contacts.

He told me that I had blepharitis and prescribed me thobradex. I did 4 eye drops for two weeks. I went back for a follow up and he said my inflammation had decreased and the crust in my eyelashes was gone. I then tried a NEW pair of monthly lenses the next day, and immediately I had a reaction where my eye got pretty red. So perhaps I had blepharitis, but I think this showed it wasn't the underlying cause of the redness. I went to another doc for a second opinion. He told me that this was caused by lack of oxygen to the eye and it was related to eye dryness - no underlying pathology. I asked him if there was a diagnosis and he said CLARE. When I take out my contacts, the redness gets a lot better, but what is really bugging me is that there still seems to be ""residue"" from the redness. I don't remember my eye being like that before this all happened and I am really frustrated that it doesn't seem to be going away. It makes me feel like I permanently harmed my eye in some way.

9495,"Hello. I am not an expert but i am suffering maybe from the same thing. There are few things that gave me a bit of relief. First off, you may not have a dry eye at all. It is called computer vision syndrome and it is giving you digital eye strain. So you may skip the eyedrops and check the results for few days. For me, simple eyedrops made matter much worse. Secondly, what i did was to find out exactly which movement is causing me the pain. For me, it was looking directly down at keyboard/ a piece of paper and immediately looking up. It may be different for you and you may try working in such a manner that this movement is done very less. I personally switched to a laptop and started using it at an arm's length. If i have to copy a from a paper, i would place it right beside the laptop keyboard so that eye movement is minimum. Thirdly, eye massage helped me a great deal. For me the pain starts in between the eye and the nose , so i started massaging it well before the symptoms start. Rubbing your arms together and applying the heat on the eyelids also helped. You may try taking steam besides warm compress. Fourthly, cut off digital work as much as possible. If you have no option, make the screens warm.

I had to move my whole head so I wouldn't move my eyes to the corners because it hurt. About 3 days ago, I started to feel like I had something under my eye. Two days ago I began to develop a stye.

9500,"For the past month or so, I was noticing a flash of light out of the corner of my peripheral every now and then. Like a small starburst would pop up on a dim or darkened wall, sometimes while I was in the shower. This isn't new as it had occurred on occasion a few years ago and I was given a dilated exam and told my retinas were fine and not to worry, things should clear up on their own. I never really had any more issues since then, maybe noticing a little flash here and there afterwards, but not very often to the point of forgetting about it. As stated before, the flashes were coming back again and I was seeing them almost every day for about a month. Same starburst pattern out of the corner of my eye. I started getting worried reading about what it could mean, but before I could get around to making an eye appt they stopped for a few days. My worry continued however about what was happening and I decided I'd call if they came back. Then I began seeing different types of flashes. Smaller, like little specks resembling glitter that would pop in and out of my vision every few minutes, even if I was just still, staring straight ahead. So I started panicking and made an appointment which I had today. I explained everything that had been going on with the flashes and requested a dilated exam to check my retinas but everything came back fine. My eyes look structurally healthy, yet the frequent glitter effect and occasional brighter flash continue, seemingly from both eyes. My optometrist explained the glitter sounds like an oxygen deprivation sort of issue and that it could be more related to the brain more than the eye itself as I'm a bit young for a PVD (30 yo). I'm not sure how I could be hypoxic yet have no other symptoms other than the eye flashing. I don't really have any floater issues, my eyes have just been a bit good and sore over the last week with some pulsing and sometimes almost stabbing pain, but it's been getting better. I guessed I'd strained them a bit with all the looking around following all the flashing blips. The optician reassured me that it's nothing serious and should clear up in time. What else could possibly be causing dozens of little flashes a day yet show no sign of retina tear or detachment? I spend way too much time on different screens each day, with the lockdown and all, but I've done so for a number of years and have never had vision issues like this. ",reddit,1,1

Here in the US I believe the standard is 60 hertz meaning that this positive to negative and back to positive occurs 60 times every second. The human eye can only detect at about 20 or so hertz, so anything with a higher frequency will just appear smoothly to the naked eye. This is also why tv and movies work.

I have been dealing with a plethora of symptoms for a few years now. For context I am a active, otherwise healthy 29 years old women. Have found ways to manage my symptoms, but no real cure or diagnosis. Everything started with neck and upper back pain. I was so uncomfortable, all the time! This usually coincided with tension headaches and sometimes what felt like a sinus headache. Painful face, jaw, teeth, gums. even the tip of my nose at its worst. My sinuses feel dry and in even dryer environments I get nose bleeds. Dry eyes, drops help but I still wake up feeling like o have sand in my eyes. A bit of cottonmouth, but eyes and sinuses are the worst of it. My eyes also feel easily strained. My vision is not that bad, but the strain can sometimes trigger a headache. Ear pressure, feels like I am on an airplane! I tried everything... aromatherapy, meditation, yoga, worked on my posture, chiropractic, massage etc. I found that exercise helps, but does not eliminate. Stress or excitement can trigger it, but also sometimes I can't understand what triggers it! I started doing keto about a year ago along with intermittent fasting. Noticed a decrease in some symptoms. Eczema and circle rashes that would show up on my wrists and ankles basically disappeared. Jaundice in the whites of my eyes that I had all my life have nearly vanished. More energy, less bloat and no long felt ""puffy. I have been feeling better and was no longer was seeking a diagnosis. Symptoms still remain, but more manageable. Now, going back just a couple months ago I decided to seek an alternative treatment for my neck, shoulder and back pain which was still driving me crazy. I went to an acupuncturist. Nothing she was doing was helping. After speaking over a course of three or four appointments she is convinced it is autoimmune related and not musculoskeletal. She herself had MS and was nearly paralyzed. Changed her diet and she is now happy and healthy. She is pushing me to take Keto a step further and try out Carnivore which I just might. Anyway, this was the first time someone had even mentioned autoimmune to me! Now after some research it's starting to make sense and I can feel myself relating to you all! Funny because I was already familiar with Soeren's syndrome because it would pop up occasionally when I would google that days symptoms. Yesterday I got my blood drawn and now I'm waiting on my results.

9538,"I was diagnosed in my late 30's. My vision was relatively stable for a long time. I started wearing hard contacts when I was in high school. I was told that hard contacts would be better for me because of my astigmatism was so high. Perhaps that was the KC and the eye doctors didn't know about it enough to diagnose? Who knows. Anyway, by the time I was diagnosed, I was never given the option of cross linking. I assume now that it was because my vision never really had gotten much worse over the years and the Dr. was really happy with how well the contacts corrected my vision. The older we get the harder the cornea gets and KC usually doesn't progress much. Anyway, years after wearing hard contacts and being progressively miserable, I got scleral lenses. My advise would be to skip trying the traditional hard lenses and go directly to scleral lenses. The scleral lenses really changed my life. The hard lenses always bothered me.

But on the development side, so if I was dropped directly on the top of my head from a somewhat tall height as a 10 or 11 year old (I was hanging by my knees on a weird rope thing my friends family had in their front yard when he untied one end of it to prank his sister, who was hanging by her hands, her feet closer to the ground, but he didn't see me, which clearly ended up with it just being a poorly executed prank. It's definitely not as high up as I thought then, but I most likely had a concussion [as I don't remember right before or afterwards other than what others told me], and should have gone to see a doctor, but his mom was a nurse, and I insisted I was fine because I hate being fussed over and so she decided to chase him until he hid in a closet [one of the parts I don't remember, but heard later, and am pretty sure my brain created a memory to fit that scenario]). Could it have started to develop post that due to the injury if it damaged that pathway or muscle in someway, but not been visibly present in my eyes (or at least noticeably enough for anyone to see) until 18 or 19? I'm a 26 year old female, and no one said anything until I was 19. I had noticed before, at around 15 or 16, but had assumed it wasn't anything abnormal (it was very subtle when I first noticed so I was like ""weird""<U+009D> and continued with whatever I was doing). But now with one being able to incredibly tiny, and the other being saucer sized, at the same time, I decided it was okay to worry some (well a while ago I decided this, but haven't been able to get it looked at due to other family things). If I have headaches and migraines, back problems, as well as a change in my mental health state and issues, could those also be connected? I have rational reasons for them not to be (my maternal grandmother had migraines, my mom has them, as well as two of my first cousins on my mom's side also have them, and both sides have minor mental health issues, mine just seem to be A LOT more problematic. I also wore converse forever, including when running, like an idiot, and did horseback riding and ballet, which can logically help dismiss the back pain, since those both often cause those issues.

9555,"Is ""Wilson"" the ""Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins""? If so, disappointing that they misdiagnosed Kimberly. Is the ""KC institution"" the ""Keratoconus Institute of Maryland"" that is part of OMNI Eye Specialists? If so, I assume Kimberly's doctor is Dr. Ivan Garcia? Based on his website, it sounds like he would be about as good an ophthalmologist as Kimberly could hope for. Are you sure they said they wanted to wait until Kimberly is 16 to do corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) for her right eye? It does sound like her left eye is too badly damaged to benefit from CXL. Did they perhaps say they wanted to defer a corneal transplant on her left eye until she was 16? If Kimberly is being seen at the Keratoconus Institute of Maryland, then I am surprised that they haven't suggested trying contact lenses for her. The practice includes a number of optometrists and they fit all types of contact lenses used for KC. While I have expressed surprise at some of the aspects of Kimberly's eye care, if she is being seen at the Keratoconus Institute of Maryland, then I would assume that she is getting the most appropriate care given all the circumstances. How is Kimberly doing with all this? To us adults it would seem like more than a child could endure. But kids can be remarkably resilient. When I was in Junior High School, two of my friends were a brother and sister with albinism. Their vision was very bad and they had to use devices that highly magnified their reading materials.

9560,"Your present situation sounds like a flair. I've been going through something similar lately. I've learned that eye pain and fatigue are essential to address, since this issue can make functioning unbearable. After your eye doc evaluates you and your eye condition is stabilized you might consider getting punctal plugs to moisten your eyes. Also, restasis really worked well for me. The plugs can take some time to get used to, especially with how tears work with them, allergy debris, etc. I wear Acuvue Oasis contact lenses with Hydraclear Plus moisturizing technology as well. Even though this extra moisture helps with wearing contacts sometimes there are days when my eyes are just burning dry and the lenses are glued to my eyeballs by nightfall! Eye drops without preservatives are a big help here and so are contact lenses rewetting drops. The biggest help for me is a nutrional boost via fish oil. It really helps but you have to take enough to see the changes. And it works pretty fast. I agree with others that dry weather and forest fire smoke is making things almost unbearable in the West. I live where the smoke is hitting up against the mountains and our air pollution right now is worse than winter inversion. As for your other body pain, that's where you have to work with a doc as well. My symptoms started in my thirties too and no-one put them together for years. What saved me is low dose naltrexone.

I've been evaluated many times by ophthalmologists over the last couple of years because of a (tiny) persistent scotoma in one eye, and everything so far has checked out.

I made an appointment with an ophthalmologist because I had a weird week with blurred vision in my right eye. It's since gotten much better and I suspect it was perhaps related to dry eye, as my allergies were terrible at the time and some eye drops did help. For other reference, I'm F, in my late thirties, no health problems and not overweight. Because of Covid appointments were backed up and I had to wait a month to get in. I went anyway, even though my vision was better. I ended up there for three hours. They ran test after test because: 1. The doctor found one large CHRPE in the back of my right eye. I knew it was there, but nobody had treated it as alarming before. 2. I apparently have large nerves in both eyes. Because of both of these things I had an OCT scan and imaging done. Apparently the discs showed no thinning, and all else, including IOP was within normal limits IOP in left eye was 11, right eye was 12). Macula looks fine, etc. All is good and well except for my large optic nerves, which she says I may have just been born with. She also found a tiny hole in my right retina near the nerve. So now I've got that to be freaked out about, too. But I have to see a retina specialist for that. Anyway, she referred me to an optic neurologist and this really worries me. Like, why refer me when all else looks fine? I find I do better with more information and when I asked her she said it was because of my optic nerves but would say no further. I obtained her notes and the images from the visit (my hospital system allows for this), and her notes say nothing beyond what I've noted above. So... is she just being super careful?

So I stopped wearing them and switched to glasses. Nothing has been better, in fact I've only had more symptoms.

9569,"1. The short answer is no, it is not a near-sighted prescription 2. You are right in the assessment that a normal progressive lens is not the best type of lens for constant intermediate work. There are options out there however that will make a progressive lens with a larger intermediate zone at the expense of a smaller distance zone in the lens, but of course that comes with more $$$. Separate glasses for distance and reading may/may not be the most helpful, as the 'just near' or 'just distance' won't technically correct for intermediate. 3. When you say your friend has only gotten reading glasses, do you mean they just have glasses with an Add of +1.50? If so, that would make sense why it works for them on the computer given that just wearing a +1.50 would provide more intermediate vision as opposed to a full near prescription ( Distance numbers and 'add' combined) Bottom Line: It's really about what your friend is most comfortable with. I will say at some point as your friend gets more birthdays they are going to be reliant on the glasses more and more and starting to use a progressive now will make it easier to adjust to them down the road as the 'add' gets higher with age.

Downtown core has a lot more promising clinics and doctors, and we initially planned to go there after. My first eye doc appointment went pretty badly. We confirmed I have a cataract on my right eye (completely cloudy and honestly blind). I mentioned to the doctor that I had eczema (I am pretty much free of it, but I wanted to mention it because it is a medical condition I had as a child), and he immediately said he could not operate due to that. He told me to call him when I'm cured.... My skin on my face is not bad. It's not cracking or anything of the sort, it's just flush and I have pink cheeks.

9608,"Hello. I've posted this in r/AskDocs but thought it might be a good idea to post here as well since the issue is eye-related. I'm writing this on behalf of my partner (25m). He's about 5'7""<U+009D>, 200lb and Caucasian. Smokes marijuana a few times a day (in the evening), no cigarettes. Usually drinks a few beers a night, but over the past month, has had barely any alcohol. Currently, he takes 60mg of Prozac for depression. Has never worn glasses, has pretty good vision, no LASIK eye surgery or any other surgery in his life. Today, while we were driving back from a grocery pickup (he was driving), he suddenly said ""everything just went double!""<U+009D> and immediately pulled off the road into a parking lot. He put the car into park and was holding his hand to his eyes. He said it came on very quickly. He was blinking a lot in an attempt to get his eyes to focus. I looked at his pupils and they were both the same size. I asked him to follow my finger left and right, and he had trouble keeping his eyes open to follow. When I started moving my finger up and down, his eyes became very ""confused""<U+009D> and couldn't follow, like he was trying to focus but it was hurting (he said later that he had a minor frontal headache in his forehead and a bit of pain around the eye muscles). I noticed nystagmus in both eyes. I also had him cover each eye, and he noted that both of his eyes were working fine and seeing well on their own, but they weren't working together (""like they were both crossed inwards""<U+009D> he said). We got out of the car to get him some fresh air and I pointed at a plane in the sky and asked him how it looked. He said it was double as well, so it was both near and far double vision. Face wasn't drooping, arm wasn't hurting, no neck pain, no weakness, no difficulty speaking, but minor headache and minor pain around eye. After about five minutes of double vision, he could see fine again, no double vision. It left as quickly as it came on. I asked him if this had happened before and he said it had only happened a few times before, although I didn't ask about when they had happened last. He drove home and seems fine now. An aneurysm was my first worry. Next that came to mind was a stroke, tumour, or some kind of brain swelling. Or something else very serious. I didn't even mention going to the ER because I know he'd shut down the idea immediately. He said he'd mention it to his doctor when he sees him next, which could be weeks or months from now. Should I be pushing further for intervention? Or is this something that can wait a few weeks or even months? I don't want to see something bad suddenly happen. Thank you for any answers in advance.

9611,"So, I am an optician at a well established optometrist in my area. We work with a non-profit organization called the Lions Club and once a month they come and pick up all our frames and lenses for donation (at least the ones patients gave up for donations). However, I have often wondered how exactly this even makes sense. Frame donations, sure, its not ideal but a donated frame makes sense to me for those in a third world country. But the lens donations? We take progressives, bifocals, single vision, transitions, anything people donate and they collect and want them. I fail to see how this makes logistical or technical sense though. How would they utilize already cut progressive lenses? They would only work for the matching frame & prescription (or at least one very similiar) and thats also assuming that the pupillary distance and seg ht match up with the donor. Same thing with the bifocal lenses, but I suppose maybe a little more leeway? The only way this really makes sense to me is if the lenses are single vision and in a matching or very similiar frame. Even then, I feel like the people who would most benefit are patients with high prescriptions or high asigmatism, both of which mandate greater accuracy of PDs and OC heights. And even if we were to assume that the technical aspect of this was sound, and that it could be done... Uncoated, CR39 single vision lenses can be had for 50 cents and stock bifocals are not much more. Even lab surfaced multifocal lenses are incredibly cheap without any coatings. I mean, sure the donated lenses may be better lens designs and have AR, but they are also old scratched and yellowed lenses. Perhaps they could strip the coatings to clean em up, though. Anyway, this has just always baffled me and I am honestly just very curious, am I missing something? If so, please enlighten me. Does this actually make sense? ",reddit,0,0

I do notice my eyes are slightly more blood shot but pressure wise my eyes have ALWAYS tested normal since using cannabis (if anything, cannabis has lowered the pressure from the coning out effects I deal with). It also depends on the mindset of the doctor. The one surgeon I talked to said I could not be on medical cannabis as it increases the pressure drastically in the eyes. I told them I have heard cannabis does the opposite as far back as the 90's when I had a friends dad who was prescribed cannabis for his glaucoma! Plus there is numerous data showing cannabis lowers intraocular pressure, but try sharing this data with most allopathic doctors and your wasting your breath. They would rather see me doped up on prednisone, meloxicam and pain pills and suffer all the side effects than needing to use ONE medicine, cannabis. I had two epi on procedures and one of them worked for about 8 years, the first one I got when I was about 27-ish. The second epi on was bunk as the light wasn't uv (I went to the same place in California.) 3rd C3R treatment was epi-off and it barely did anything as I felt the b-vitamin formula and UV light wasn't the same as what I had in California back in 2007-ish. If I do corneal transplant surgeries I feel that medical cannabis could be a benefit but I need to find a doctor who is in agreement with this. I have read literature on medical cannabis as to why it Cannot be used for solid organ recipients (lungs, heart & especially kidneys) due to medical cannabis being stated that it lowers immunity to fungal infections and kidney transplants are highly susceptible to fungal infections that lead to failure of the transplant.

It got to the point where my mom and husband were feeling really down because I didn't want to celebrate the pregnancy or plan or do any of the fun stuff people do when they're pregnant. I was just so focused on potential loss as if it were a guarantee... The way I was handling it before was to just constantly read everything I could - all the research articles I could get my hands on/every reddit story etc... and then just trying to suppress it/numb out during the rest of the time. But like any type of ""checking"" behavior it never really works to permanently reduce anxiety and sometimes just makes it worse. Eventually I started going in a quiet room and night and meditating and then allowing the emotions to come out rather than trying to ""research my way out of the fear."" What I realized when I started quieting my mind and allowing the emotions was that I was trying to avoid getting attached to the baby because I was so terrified of the vulnerability and the pain it would cause. But the truth was, I was already attached to the baby. If something happened I was going to hurt/be devastated no matter what. I couldn't prepare my way out of the pain. Something also clicked within me that the reality is, no pregnancy is fully without risk. There is always some chance something could go wrong and that doesn't stop others from enjoying and celebrating their pregnancies (Not to discount the stress of knowing ahead of time that you are at a specific percentage risk for a specific issue). I also realized I was being incredibly hard on myself and blaming myself and the almost punishing myself (and everyone else around me) for the situation. I had to let go and I started to be kinder to myself about the whole thing. I also thought about how I would help my future child through fears and feelings of her own. How can I face scary things and possibly incredibly painful things? How could I live the way I would want her to be able to? I don't want to make it sound like it has all been an airy fairy /crystals and incense type experience either though, because there are some grounded practical steps I've taken to handle the stress and fears as well. 1. My rheumatologist put me on plaqunil while I was trying due to the literature showing that it quite possibly cuts the risk of heart block in half. It is my understanding this can be effective if started by 10 weeks. Forewarning if you seek to be put on the medicine, you may get some push back because the studies have only been done on mothers that have already had a child with heart block, not first time mothers. My maternal fetal specialist said while they didn't think it was necessary, they considered the medicine safe and would go along with the rheumatologist. Being on HCQ has given me some added peace of mind. 2. I continued to see a counselor and have been able to talk with her about my fears and the pregnancy process as well as some of the darker feelings of blaming myself etc... This has been very helpful. 3. I enrolled in a research study for Anti-Ro positive mothers. The primary investigator of the study is one of the top researchers in this area (Jill Buyon out of NYU Langone). The student is called StopBloq [https://stopbloq.org](https://stopbloq.org) 1. Basically they sent me an at home fetal doppler monitor and provided training videos and sample audio files of normal/abnormal heart rates. I then take a reading 3 times and day and send it over to them. If at any time something sounds out of the norm, I can text an on-call pediatric cardiologist who will review the audio file and let me know if I need to have an emergency echocardiogram. They linked me up with a research site in my state where I can go if necessary. Having this added support has been an amazing blessing. 2. In summary, I hear her heartbeat 3 times a day in conjunction with the normal standard of care weekly echocardiograms at my local maternal fetal medicine specialist. Hearing it before I go in makes it so much less scary... like ""oh my gosh what are they going to find this week"" type thing. 3. If you are in the USA and less than 18 weeks pregnant you may be able to enroll in the study if you are interested. There are some states without a participating site, but many states have one. 4. I got a better understanding of the reality of heart block. It is common amongst those of us with this autoantibody to know the 2%/16-20% numbers. 2% if you're a first time mom, 16-20% if your a mom who has already had a baby with heart block. But what I wasn't familiar with was... if it happens, then what. Well, the fact is more babies with this type of heart block live than die. That is not to discount complications they can have nor the scary reality of the 20-30% who pass away. But it did help me to realize that the worst case scenario for a first time mom was a small percent of the already small percent if that makes sense. I really hope something in the long wall of text has been helpful for you. I know how awful and dark the feelings can be and I hope you can get some relief from them. ",reddit,0,1

If she's actually monitoring your pressures, there's an old school thing some doctors do where they check your eye pressure over the span of several hours to see how it fluctuates to determine your max pressure. I see this rarely done now and doubt this is what she was referring to. I'm not sure why she needs the PCP but my best guess is that she wants to do a visual field and OCT but she lacks the equipment so she needs to refer you. Maybe the referral to a specialist with the equipment is needed by your PCP for insurance purposes?

9639,"Hello I have been experiencing dizziness for more than 4 years. But what I mean by dizziness is something different from what dizziness really is. It is not like you are spinning or so. Imagine that you are holding your phone horizontal and have opened the camera. Just shake it gently and then just stop doing so and hold it normally. That is the kind of experience I am suffering. Years ago I had an MRI test and nothing came up and as well I had a balance test to check my inner ear and nothing came up either. So I thought that it would be psychological but I have had a time when I needed to use antidepressants and I really benefited from them but that dizziness problem didn't go away. So I think too it has nothing to do with my psychology and it was just a short time I am totally fine. I have an high astigmatism and myopia like 7. I have been using glasses more than 10 years. Every optician I visited said that dizziness has nothing to do with eyes and my eye tests came up pretty good like retina, corneal tests, etc. It has really no pattern like it happens when I am sitting or walking or whatever. But what I noticed is that it tends to be worse when I use computer more than usual. It is like the veins in my eyes have a kind of pressure on them. In extreme cases of that dizziness, the vision or the environment spins so fast that I feel like holding an object and it lasts 5-10 seconds and during that time it is like my brain gets lighter and you know like something is being extracted from my brain but when it stops this feeling goes. It is the extreme and continual version of that telephone camera example and it happens rarely. I feel uncomfortable in my daily life because I have continuous fear that that may happen while driving or crossing roads etc. I also suspect that it may be due to some problems in my neck area or so but I have no posture problems or neck pain or so. That dizziness sometimes even happen in bed like just lying. Do you know the feeling you are falling down in your dream and wake up jumping? Yeah that is exactly what is happening sometimes though it is extremely rare but very unpleasant. Have anyone experienced. something like that please let me know and share your experiences/guesses etc. Thank you â™¥ï¸ Edit1: I have seen an optician for routine check and my eye numbers are same for 1 year or so. However I have noticed long time ago that with my right eye (which has a higher number like 7+ astigmat than my left eye which is like 5+ astigmat) I see worse. Is it normal because I can't read the same things that I can read with my left eye. Aren't glasses supposed to correct vision? Or the high number difference between my eyes causes so ? Is it somehow related to dizziness? I was about to ask this to my optician but I was so desperate that I forgot :( ( I have to say that I see well with my glasses but it is just one eye closed observation of mine hope I expressed myself well) Edit 2: I was a kind of person who used to spend more than 5 hours in front of a screen however for 2-3 years I am using it when necessary and for a short period of time. Can it be related to that fact like my eyes can't handle it anymore ? Has it become oversensitive and maybe somehow causes my eye veins to overwork and put pressure on them and this in turn makes me dizzy. ",reddit,0,0
9640,"I'll start off by saying that I realize am in a very fortunate position compared to many here. This isn't a post to brag but rather hopefully give some insight to those that may be where I was a few years ago. Keratoconus runs in my family (my mom has had a transplant in each eye) so it was always something that I had been terrified of getting. I was always very diligent in bringing it up to my eye doctor any time I had an appt. About 6 years ago, I got the update that I'd need to go see an opthalmologist who specializes in Keratoconus. Sure enough shortly after, I was diagnosed. The good news was that it was still early. I was still able to see 20/20 with glasses, but I knew it was a race against the clock for me. At the time, the US wasn't fully approved for CXL so I made sure to be even more diligent in getting routine exams until it was. After it became approved in the US, about 3 years ago, I got CXL in my ""bad"" eye and a few months after that got it in my ""good"" eye. Now every time I go see the eye doctor, I'm paranoid that my eyes are still progressing and that CXL wasn't effective for me. However, last week during my yearly exam, my eye doctor told me that my prescription and eyes have stabilized and there was very little change from the year before. I was over the moon! Not only that, she was now able to fit me with (non-custom) soft contacts for astigmatism!!! (Like what people without Keratoconus wear!) I almost cried right there in the office. Again, I realize that I'm in a very rare position and that seeing 20/20 with glasses let alone wearing soft contacts is out of the question for many. But I just wanted to share this because early detection and treatment was key for me. With Keratoconus, it's not a matter of if, but when and how fast your eyes get worse. Yes, even possibly in an eye that may be ""good"" right now. If you're on the fence about CXL, and your doctor is advising you to get it, imo it's absolutely worth the pain and frustration for a few months after. (I'm not a doctor so please only follow your Doctor's advice.) Or if you're nervous you have Keratoconus, see a doctor asap. The sooner you do, the better. ",reddit,0,0

I'd keep an eye on my tests to make sure that you are being tested regularly. It's always smart for an autoimmune patient with brain fog to keep an eye out for their thyroid tests. Brain fog and muscle pain are huge in hypothyroidism and there's quite a lot of variation in how GPs and endos test and treat for it. Two women with the same symptoms and same test results will often have different treatment options because one doc will not treat and one will. It can make a huge difference in quality of life that you have a doc who understands the more current strategies.

9660,"Hi guys, thanks for any answer! I don't know where to seek help in quarantine **First,** i don't know what i have. It all started five years ago (i'm 30 now) as maybe a common problem of eye strain, everytime i read more than 20 pages of a book my eyes felt tired, if i kept reading i usually felt a weird kind of headache that tylenol couldn't fix, even if it was a lesser pain. After that i was so tired that couldn't keep reading, or playing videogames, or using my phone. At the next day, most of the time i still felt fatigued, but i could read or play and start my problem all over again. **Second**, two or three years ago a new kind of problem started. Sometimes, maybe once per month, little drops of blood in the white of my eyes appeared *(derrame ocular* is the name in spanish, i don't know the translation in english), along with visible veins in the white of my eyes too. They come for no reason at all, even if had a normal day without reading or focusing my vision on something. When i see my eyes like that i know i'm going to have an awful day. Usually i can't do nothing when it happens, i feel worse than when i have normal eye strain, i feel an abnormal blood pressure (maybe high, i eat lemon when it happens to fix it), after a few hours my eyebags turn really dark, even the parts of my nose surrounding my eyes turn dark, and even at the next day when i feel better they keep looking like that for a while. One day i just didn't care about that blood in my eyes and kept reading, the result was so extreme that i puked, i felt like drunk, and i had to go to the hospital at 2 am!! Which by the way, they didn't know what to do. **Third**, i have gone to the ophtalmologist (that's the name in english? Or optometrist? haha) three times for this problem. They all have given me similar prescriptions for my glasses. They were quite fast to treat me and they didn't care that much of what i said, one of them told me it was my constant use of my phone (then i forced myself to completely not use my phone for one week but i still felt pain after playing or reading), the other said it was a ""brain"" problem for the imbalance between my eyes. I don't know if that's right because i didn't felt this when i was younger, specially at university when i read all day and night. And my prescriptions haven't changed that much since i was like 22 and changed my glasses. **Fourth**, i have used ocular lubricants and they make me feel better, but they just delay my problem. I have used three brands, one local brand had hypromellose and dextran, and the other two are Systane Ultra and Systane Balance. The three just give me the same result, i still feel tired, but at least i can keep living. The three can't do nothing about the problem i have when blood appears in my eyes.

9661,"your doctor seems to be of the opinion that correcting the full amount may cause you to become overcorrected and have an eye drift postoperatively. Since you're 23 years old that double vision that you would get from being over corrected wouldn't be something that you would get used to or go away on its own, unless your eyes eventually started to cross back and words again. if you wear glasses then prism can be added to your glasses to help correct the double vision if you were to have it after surgery otherwise you would have to cover one eye with an eye patch. the reason you don't have double vision right now is due to a phenomenon called suppression. Your right eye is the one that turns in and it was probably like that since you were a little child going by the history that you gave. when you were little and your eye started turning in you would have initially had double vision and your brain would have basically turned your right eye off to avoid the double vision. Turning that eye off is called suppression and it happens in the brain. Children's brains have the ability to create suppression but adults brains do not. We lose the ability to do this somewhere around the end of the first decade of life. Once kids start developing suppression they can also develop what's called amblyopia, which is a reduced visiob due to inactivity of the eye caused by suppression. Suppression only affects part of the eye, called a scotoma. The part of the eye that's being turned off depends on if the eye is crossing in words are drifting out words. Because your eye is crossing in there is a very specific part of the eye that's being turned off. If we were to realign your eyes and over-correct you so that your eye is now drifting outward it would be a different part of your eye that would be receiving stimulus. That part of the eye was never trained to turn off and the result would be that you would have double vision. ",reddit,0,0

My eye doctor said that my dry eye is almost definitely caused by my autoimmune issues. Is lipiflow safe with these conditions? I have been flare free for 1 year on immunosuppressants. Although my iop has been curiously higher in the low 20s recently and I still get flashes. ",reddit,0,0
9666,So about a month ago I woke up to my vision being cloudyish. We had gotten a dog a few days prior to it and I have a dog allergy. It gets better with eye drops but comes back same with allergy medicine. The only relief I get is being away from home. I also find it worse when I'm straining my eyes. From wake up to bed I'm on an electronic screen or reading. I couldn't get in to the eye doc until this week and I'm honestly terrified. I'm 21 M. I'm supposed to wear glasses I have an astigmatism in both eyes and far sighted? I'm the one that can see close but has trouble far away. I was kinda meh about it and didn't wear them and they got broke and I just never thought to go to the eye doc until now that I have an issues. Also can someone dumb down for me cloudy vs blurry? I may be describing my symptoms wrong. Any advice or reassurance would be helpful. ,reddit,1,1

9669,"Keeping in mind frequency is all relative. While it may look very frequent to you, it may still be infrequent enough that the doctor is comfortable watching it, and feels that binocular development is not significantly impacted. As for glasses, the issue isn't keeping glasses on a child, so much as that the doctor likely determined that glasses won't be helpful. Prisms aren't always practical. Some children don't respond well to programs (as in, their eye turn isn't affected by the prisms), and sometimes the size of the turn is large enough that it would require more prism than is feasible in glasses. As for angle measurements, your doctor likely took some, or at least estimated the size. Infants and toddlers can be finicky, which makes getting a truly accurate angle measurement difficult. Ultimately though, an angle of (for example) 25 vs 35 prism dioptres should not affect management at this stage. You asked about patching - the literature that exists on patching for intermittent exotropia is not on strict consensus. Most data shows either no benefit, or modest benefit. I am not aware of any data showing negative effects in this situation. If you're not comfortable with your doctor's recommendations, there is no harm in seeking a second opinion. ",reddit,0,0

9672,"Yes. Since you're only becoming nearsighted now, it most likely depends on how you use your eyes. I stopped getting worse at 20 years old, when I asked my optician to give me weaker glasses for computer distance. A friend of mine, who was just starting to experience worse vision and headaches after late evenings, was prescribed positive lenses to prevent strain and he's kept his 20/20 vision so far. I don't know what strategy would be best for you, maybe it's fine just not using glasses, or maybe some weak reading glasses could be helpful. You could ask your optician (or follow the DIY path if you know what you're doing). I can add that adding even a subtle element of motion when working close, thus not standing still like a statue, works wonder in helping your eyes bring things into focus. ",reddit,0,0
9673,"The drug that may cause blindness is called plaquenil. The blindness is caused by retinal toxicity, but that is very rare. You get yearly eye exams while on plaquenil so that they can test for the retinal toxicity. When they catch it early, the vision loss can be reversed. Plaquenil is a drug that is used to prevent systemic complications from Sjogren's and organ involvement. It is literally the most mild drug they can give you in terms of side effects. I would consider doing some more research before shutting it down. You are young, you don't want to develop any organ damage from this disease. BTW, I am 20 years old and have been on plaquenil for almost 16 years. I have not had any retinal toxicity. ",reddit,1,1
9674,"THIS! I was in excruciating pain for years, but too ashamed to go to the dentist. When I finally got up the nerve for a consultation, the tech came in to do a teeth cleaning. I told her I was there for a consultation as my teeth couldn't be saved. I started crying, ashamed. I didn't have my Sjogrens diagnosis, but I'm celiac and that can cause teeth damage, too. The dentist came in and was very sweet and understanding. That made all of the difference. She was upset I had waited so long as I had to have been in extreme pain, which I was. We made a plan to pull my remaining top teeth and the molars on my bottom left that were causing great pain. It took me a long time to heal due to autoimmune disorders. Finally had to go on steroids. That helped. We didn't have dental insurance, but this office financed in house. They added 10% and we had to put 30% down. We pulled some money out of our 401k to cover half of it. Otherwise, I would never have been able to afford it. I didn't get the bottom done while I was there because I was working full time and going to work without teeth was not an option. I couldn't stay home for weeks and weeks. Please consider offering in house credit, if you don't already. I've needed to get the bottom done, but am facing the same issue, but with insurance. We moved to a different state and I need to find a new dentist. It's scary. We also took a huge loss in income by moving. I worked for my husband and the owner, husband was VP, understood my health issues and allowed flexibility. My health has gotten worse, as well, and I'm currently appealing a denial for disability. Thus, we lost $40k a year. It's a lot harder to come up with the money. We are building our own home, we are living in it, but it's not complete, without financing. My husband is literally doing all the work himself. (The owner sold his company and we were promised part of the sale. We got $11k. His severance should've been 60k and vacation another 60k. We kept that business open for 10 years and got the shaft. Still pisses me off. We had to cash out his 401k to pay for the property and get the building up.) So here I wait. I have one intact bottom molar. The other, which had a root canal, broke apart and the filling is gone. I have 9 bottom teeth and they are all rotten. I'm scared, again. Having so many problems with the previous experience and with my plate. I really need to get posts in top and bottom to anchor them in so I can enjoy eating again. What I recommend? In house credit. Advertise that y'all have experience with dental problems due to autoimmune disorders. Somehow let people know that y'all understand and they shouldn't be ashamed.

9680,"So, I'm 19 y/o and have always had pretty good eyesight my entire life (no glasses, contacts, etc.). I received my first dose of the Phizer Covid-19 vaccine on March 15th. I didn't really have any immediate side effects (other than sore arm). About 3 days later, my family and I did a small road-trip to another city and I did the driving. It was about a 4-hour drive (stopped 1-2 times), but that was when I first noticed that my eyes were getting a little strained. When we got to the hotel, I noticed my eyes were a little red but they didn't feel so fatigued yet. I'm also slightly allergic to cats, and I think that the room we stayed in may have had a cat previously as it was a ""pet-friendly hotel."" We stayed there for about 3-4 days and I noticed that my eyes would tend to burn up when inside the room (what usually happens when I'm near cats / cat fur) but they were relatively fine when outside / outdoors. Anyways, so I thought the eye burning/itching would have stopped by the time we got home, but it didn't really. I tried stye eye drops and pink eye drops but they didn't really do much. I also tried some antihistamine allergy medicine some days, and it sometimes helped a little. I also tried cold compress with a cold, wet towel, but it only provided some temporary relief. This went on for about two weeks and now, they no longer burn/itch. However, as of the past week-ish, I've gotten some substantial eye fatigue. I also tried some artificial tears recently, thinking I had dry eyes, but that didn't really help at all. I haven't really had any changes to my normal sleep schedule, stress-level, or total computer/screen usage either. I've also tried wearing those blue-light filtering glasses when using my laptop. I even got 10 hours of sleep the other day and still woke up to tired eyes. I got my second dose this past Monday and towards the end of the day, I could barely keep my eyes open (this is coming off of 10 hours of sleep too). I've also been getting some migraines/headaches because of the eye fatigue. Lying down does help the discomfort a little tho. I'm at a loss of what to do now. My whole productivity has kinda been ruined. I thought it would have resolved itself by now after 3 weeks, but apparently not. Even during allergy season, I've never really had problems with my eyes at all really. I can't really pinpoint what else was the cause other than the vaccine which is unfortunate. Does anyone have any suggestions / recommendations what to do? ",reddit,1,1
9681,"Hope I'm not too late to this - I had a reply typed out within half an hour of posting and it just... Didn't post? My wifi is terrible, so not surprising. Here's what I wrote: Another 24 year old year with a large part of her self-identity stemming from her intellectual prowess chiming in here. I've probably had Sjogren's since I was 8, and Hashimoto's before that. While brain fog hasn't been my *primary* symptom or even my tertiary symptom, it has been the one I have struggled emotionally with more than any other. I'm also working on my PhD in physics, and so the brain fog has impacted my work quite substantially. Looking back on the tail end of my four-year undergraduate experience, what I now know as the Sjogren's brain fog started to kick in. It would manifest in the form of being unable to focus on anything for more than about 5 minutes when previously I could focus on something uninterrupted for 50+min stretches. On brain fog days, I wouldn't be able to retain new information, and any work I did would either be completed agonizingly slowly (like you said, hours for a single page of information), or that work would be riddled with errors. It was incredibly frustrating for those last two years of uni, and especially my last semester when it was most frequent and I had 3 senior projects to complete. It got worse when I started my PhD two years ago. Everything I learned my last two years of undergrad, including the base physics I need to do any higher-level work, has evacuated my brain because of the brain fog I had during undergrad. Even worse, the brain fog days became more frequent, and the brain fog itself became more intense. I ended up having to go on medical leave in November 2019 because the previous 6 months had gotten so bad. I'd been hospitalized for other symptoms off and on in October, and the brain fog rendered me quite literally unable to do any work on my research. The best I can describe it is that my vocabulary almost entirely vanished. I could barely form coherent sentences. I couldn't read, partly because I had double vision constantly, and partly because my brain would get part way through a sentence and then fizzle out so completely that my vision would go entirely white, all my thoughts would completely scatter, and sometimes, in addition to forgetting what the sentence had contained up to that point, I'd forget where I was and my own name. The same ""words go white"" phenomenon, as I was able to succinctly and ineffectually describe it to my doctors, was also prevalent when I was writing, coding, or speaking. This meant I couldn't learn new ideas. I couldn't hold concepts in my head long enough to form connections or generate ideas. I couldn't do anything that would move my PhD forward. Hell, I couldn't even form thoughts like ""I'm hungry"" or ""My joints are very crunchy and it hurts a lot"" or ""I need to move this spoon to my mouth so I can get enough calories to not die."" It was really bad. While the only way to address my issues this last year was through medication, something that I understand isn't in the cards for you, the meds haven't completely helped the brain fog go away. I'm *still* on medical leave (thanks, covid), but I am trying to do some light work at home, and I've found some ways to get by. Like with you, trying a series of strict regimens of diets and supplements did absolutely nothing for me, and exercise only serves as a stress reducer. Valuable at times, but not a complete solution. Instead, in order to compensate for the Sjogren's brain fog, I use skills I learned from the brain fog I've experienced with Hashimoto's for the last decade. When I feel the ever-present brain fog increasing in severity, I take a series of steps: 1) I make myself a cup of tea, no matter what I was doing before. I find that the tea and the process of making it helps me calm down emotionally, and as others have stated, your own stress can be your biggest obstacle with the brain fog. While making/drinking it, I prepare for the rest of my day as will be discussed in steps 2 and 3. 2) I think about how I can change my schedule for the rest of the day to be as non-physical as possible. Doing lots of physical activity when the brain fog peaks makes me less able to do anything mental, so I try to adjust what my day holds to the best of my control to prioritize the mental tasks. Where can I take a bus instead of walking or driving? Do I have the budget and supplies to eat pre-prepared meals instead of cooking? Can I skip my band or kung fu practice this evening? 3) I think about all the tasks I have for the rest of the day and the rest of the week. Is there anything immediately due tomorrow that I have to power through? If so, I move that immediately to the top of my to-do list so I can complete it before the brain fog gets too overwhelming. Then, I move anything that requires learning important information or writing papers to the bottom of my list so I can tackle them when the brain fog is less bad. More minor tasks I find I have success in during brain fog are menial and repetitive tasks, like number crunching, replying to daily emails, organizing my workspace and research items, and developing soft skills. 4) Once I have a handle on how I can adjust my day, I make another cup of tea and move myself into a workspace that has at least one spot of a completely bare, white wall or ceiling easily visible from where I sit. When the brain fog starts becoming overwhelming and stressful while I work, I stare at that blank spot for a while and do my best to think of nothing because the lack of stimulation it provides clears my head. This makes me less stressed and makes the brain fog temporarily less invasive. Some days, staring at that spot 3 minutes out of every hour is enough to stay productive. Some days, I have to space out to it for half an hour at a time to accomplish anything. On bad days, sometimes I just lay down on the floor for a bit while I veg to the blank spot on the wall. 5) I keep tea and water readily available throughout the day, as well as small snacks. When the brain fog gets bad, I've found that taking a literal minute to disengage from my work and focus on the act of eating/drinking re-energizes my brain. I've found particular success switching back and forth between green tea, lemon and ginger tea, and hard ginger candies. 6) The SECOND emotions start to come in, the second I start feeling frustrated at my brain instead of the work, I stop. Walk away. Go to the bathroom. Stare at a blank wall in another room. Go outside and listen to birds. Whatever. Just physically remove myself from the frustration until I am calm again. The only way to live and have any form of productivity with constant and persistent brain fog is to not let it rule my life. To live with it as a symbiote because it never really goes away, yes, but to not bow to it. Some days are better, some days are worse, and I find doing these things allow me to let my brain rest throughout the day while still feeling as though I'm productive amd proactive. I think it works because these tasks focus on clearing my head to prevent me from wallowing in the stress and depression. With Sjogren's, stress is one of the biggest factors in worsening a flare. It can be tough to acknowledge the internal stress brain fog causes, and so incredibly easy to write everything off as ""if only I work harder, I'll be better."" My ability to function increases a thousandfold when I listen to my brain instead of my stress and insecurity. If my brain doesn't want to work, I don't work. I stare at a blank wall or listen to music or go for a walk or make tea, whatever feels right in the moment, and I trust my brain will tell me when it is ready to work again. It never takes my brain as long to rest and recover as the voice of fear in my head screams at me that it will. Also, when the resource you depend on more than anything else for your identity and your career fails you continuously, it is hard not to experience depression. Like someone said earlier, it's not a depression as we generally think of it per se because you know what's causing it, but the constant undercurrent of fear, not knowing if your brain will fail you so completely that you have to change who you are at your core and so that you'll never be able to do any of your favorite activities again, is harrowing. It's trauma. Listen to your body. It knows best. In a way, I'm lucky my brain fog started at 15, because I was able to learn how to listen to my body in order to combat brain fog while in the safety net of easy classes and no bills. It's harder when you're older and there are real-life consequences. Also, since you asked if people had success at dealing with brain fog and if there was any hope, let me tell you about my last semester of undergrad. My brain fog and other health issues were so bad I barely left my room, and at one point I had to get Dean approval to take two weeks off. The entirety of that two week break, I laid in bed, dozing and staring at a blank wall and thinking of nothing, while Star Trek talked at me in the background 24/7 and my wonderful, amazing housemates brought me food and water. Because I let myself rest, I succeeded in keeping top grades, earning highest honors on my cognitive science undergrad thesis and physics senior research project, getting a paper published on a project unrelated to either major, organizing and running the first ever science conference for undergrads at the United Nations after 2 years of work, winning a competition to shadow the UK-NYC Consul General and UK ambassador to the UN for a few days, and graduating.

9694,"Hey guys! I have recently noticed something weird about my eyes. A little background, I had corrective surgery for esotropia when I was around four years old, I am twenty eight now. The surgery was largely successful and I know I have been very lucky to have not had any major issues since. However, I started taking a new medication a few years back and the medication is known to be a muscle relaxant. I have always had a fear of my esotropia returning for some reason so decided to keep an eye on it (pun not intended but I'll take it.) I did notice that when I purposely put my eyes out of focus my corrected eye goes out to the right by quite a bit. I recently changed medication but it still does it so I guess it has always been a thing and I haven't noticed. I asked my friends and family in fear that my eye does this at other times and people are scared to tell me. The response was a resounding no, nobody has noticed any issues at all except my mother who says sometimes when I'm tired it can drift a little but nothing major. An ex from 10 years ago also confirmed this, said he noticed it but ""it wasn't the end of the world.""

9709,"I wouldn't say severe but it has impacted my life drastically. I am currently 21 years old, i was first diagnosed for keratoconus when i was 18, where i was advised that i would need surgery but i'm still in early stages. So i took it lightly not knowing the seriousness of this disease and started my College. I am a Cadet Pilot and we get tested for vision every year and the requirement is a strict 6/6 on either eyes and 20/20 vision on both. Sometime during the course of my training, whenever i closed my right eye, i could see perfectly well, but when i closed my left eye, i couldn't read very well, like shadowed writing and a halo of light. This had me worried and so in 2020 when i used to fly, i was due for my next medical assessment, i was asked to close my right eye and read the alphabets, i was able to read perfectly, but when i was asked to close my left eye and read with the right, i couldn't read the last 2 lines. i was struggling, squinching my eyes, opening them wide open, raising my head, lowering my head, nothing seemed to work, i almost reached the breaking point and had tears in my eyes as my whole career flashed before my eyes, everything that i've dreamt of and worked so hard for is being compromised by this tiny, yet compromising factor. They ran a couple of tests and sat me down, and told me that i needed to search another career. I broke down, it affected me mentally and drove me into depression. I had worked all my life, spent all my money and time and effort, and it just got flushed down the toilet just like that. I frantically asked if there was any situation, to which he replied that it was late and none of the methods would make much difference. As soon as my flying was over, i flew out to see one of the best eyes doctors and got consulted for cross linking on both eyes. It's been 3 months since then and i've been regularly having check ups and there seems to be no drop in eye power, and i consulted for a eye lens fitting and i could somewhat achieve 6/6 vision on both eyes, things are looking up and i'm much better knowing maybe i haven't got it as worse. Because when i was at the hospital, i met with a 11 year old who had to get an eye transplant and still couldn't see and had to be guided by his mother at all times, comparing with that, i'd say i'm blessed.

I am not here looking for a diagnosis but for suggestions as to what I should have doctors look into next as they don't know themselves what to check so I'm trying to figure it out for myself so I can point them in the right direction. The first issue was digestive issues that started around 6 years ago, I have had an endoscopy where they took a biopsy and they said everything looks fine. My stools used to be very loose but the last couple years haven't been too bad, though I still have to use the toilet 5+ times per day (to poop). Then around 5 years ago I had a case of Labrynthitis (inner ear viral infection) and all my other symptoms seemed to start exactly at this time so I'm sure the virus has triggered this (which is why I suspect autoimmune). The symptoms are as follows: Dry mouth Fatigue Neurological decline (memory, problem solving skills have gone to shit) Excessive sweating Derealisation Sensitivity to loud noise Sensitivity to bright light (particularly sunlight) Balance/coordination problems Joint problems (stupid amount of injuries from working out even though I use good form and don't lift heavy) Alcohol intolerance (get drunk much easier and hangovers are 10 times worse than previously, rarely drink more than a pint or 2 now) Wounds take a long time to heal I was also diagnosed with psoriasis and Raynauds at a young age, had what doctors told me was a psoriasis guttate flair recently and it has cleared on my body but my head is still sore/itchy and it's causing bald patches on my scalp. I have had many blood tests in this time, and have been negative for everything except for slightly elevated liver enzymes but I have had both an ultrasound scan and a fibroscan on my liver and everything is fine. Have been tested for T1, T2 and insipdous diabetes, kidney functions, ANA and all were negative.

So this all started almost 3 years ago (April 2018) when I was 24, suddenly one day in the office I get what looks like a [red stye on my left upper eyelid](https://i.imgur.com/2yq7In1. webp). Three days later it disappears and it [begins to turn red](https://i.imgur.com/EMoAgdh. I suspected an infection and got some antibiotics which cleared it up right away until it ran out. Begin to [document everything](https://i.imgur.com/y7mUu60. webp) and suspect it's inflammation, worse so in the left eye but still apparent in both. Several months later finally get an opthalmologist appointment, does a quick dry eye test (using strips under each eyelid) and diagnoses me with dry eye syndrome, prescribes Xiidra which proceedes to work for 2 years (of only taking it once every other day instead of twice daily). Now comes the weird part, I noticed 2 concrete things: 1) Omega 3-6-9 WILL override the Xiidra (even using twice daily) and cause terrible inflammation, taking Omega 3 alone is completely fine, and; 2) just recently donated blood and shortly after noticed eyes weren't as inflammated, I've now gone 3 weeks without Xiidra whereas before the donation it was still inflammated when briefly pausing the drops for 2-3 days. Eyes are still red like in the 2nd pic but no where near as bad and only need lubricants once or twice a day (mostly in the morning). If anyone's got any incite into possible causes of this I'd greatly appreciate it! Possibly unrelated but I suspect it could be contributing to more general health issues, mainly I seemed to have given myself whiplash symptoms (from strained suboccipital/SCM) from exercising (bench presses and curls) and my neck/shoulders had a burning sensation (possibly inflammation) and had restless leg syndrome before it happened.

I have never worn glasses because I needed to, just because they helped me read at a distance while driving. I see just fine in the day and the majority of things at night without them. They help with nighttime reading at a distance for small details. In my opinion, I see fine. No ghosting, no seeing double, no issues focusing, no halos, no streaking, no bent (straight) lines. At a distance at night, finer details are much better with glasses on, but that is really it. I am trying to join the service as a pilot and I passed the initial exam for correction 20/20, no colorblindness, no depth issues, and a prescription within tolerance. I, being my proactive minded self, went to get my eyes evaluated for LASIK because I knew I had astigmatism. This is when I had my first corneal topography done. The nurse said I had irregular astigmatism (she believed I have Keratoconus (KC)) and I needed to see the ophthalmologist. \*Caveat here, KC isn't just disqualifying for a pilot slot, but for joining the military altogether. The only position in all of the military that requires a corneal topography is pilot\* Fast forward a few weeks to the doctor's visit. The doc is very well respected and the only corneal specialist in my area. I believe his words to me were something like ""I am giving you a very liberal diagnosis with your topography scans as an 'irregular astigmatism' and the fact that you are easily correctable to 20/20. If I were to diagnose you with KC, it will follow you forever, which is not what I want for you if you can still get in the service with a different position if they don't do the scans. I fear a military Ophthalmologist may not see you the same way I do and write you off with KC and you can never get in, not just as a pilot. You might go about a happy career with 0 issues, or they have you get corneal cross-linking done later on if it were to become an issue and that's it. Many pilots have it and never know until they are 40 and they finally find it.""<U+009D> I just don't want to give up on my dream or a chance to get there is a possibility.

9722,"Hi all. I am in my mid 30ies, I believe my keratoconus was diagnosed in my teenage years, when CXL wasn't a thing yet. My mother has KCN, too, but apparently it never progressed as fast as mine: 12 years ago, I had a (DALK) cornea transplant in my right eye. Left eye remained stable for the next ten years, and now changed a little because I decided to get epi-on CXL (that's another long story). Back in the day, as soon as they saw the KCN was getting really bad, they just gave me the usual ""get RGP lenses"" spiel. That's what I did, and I hated them. Even got an infection on my right eye because of the RGP scracting the cornea. Not long after, the transplant happened, and I stopped wearing them alltogether. Some time after, an optician suggested I should try soft toric lenses. Actually, they worked pretty well. On my transplanted eye, I got 8/10, on my KCN eye 10/10. Wow! In general, my eyes are pretty sensitive, and I have to say, even with soft contacts I couldn't wear them all day. I had my tricks, like: morning with glasses, as soon as the eyes get too tired (because of the strain of working in front of a monitor), switch to contacts. Sometimes if I went out in the afternoon and came back at night, I would them on before going out, and late at night my eyes would get so dry, no matter how many eye drops I would put. But aside from these issues, the soft toric lenses served me well. Now my (vertical) coma got really bad on my left eye after CXL, and wanted to try sclerals. I have a few questions for you guys: \- does anybody wear sclerals on the graft? How long can you wear it? I read online how the hypoxia from the scleral (even with very very high DK, and with a thin reservoir) can cause problems to the graft. I have a beautiful DALK that served me well for the latest 12 years, and even if vision is not ""optimal"", I think it's still better than risking graft rejection. What is your experience? \- what about KCN? Did anybody try PROSE and EyePrint Pro? These seem like the ""best"" brands doing custom sclerals. How do they fare? How would you compare them to hybrid lenses? Thanks in advance for sharing your experience! ",reddit,0,0

The boost is barely noticeable in the smallest frame I have, which is about a 27 height and my eyes are vertically centred in.

At 25 I got 5 more years to figure it out. Rn I work as a police officer. So I can speak as to reasons why I 100% understand they don't want KC in the military. With RGP or Sclerals. You are simply a risk. A huge risk. Say infantry as a somewhat extreme example. If you have you sclerals on in the gas chamber. You're eyes are not gonna be happy, if you lose the lense. You're screwed and useless to them. If it cracks in your eye (has happened to me) you're not only screwed but now your medic is acting as on optometrist trying to remove that lense from your eye. Now that exaggerated example is over. I do think they should relax KC restrictions as plenty of non contact lense options are very very close to being ""cures (not including transplant) but MEPS code simply states. KC of any degree is disqualifying. I fell where you're coming from I do. I was just looking at BSing my way through again hoeing they wouldn't catch it.

I can shoot in the 99th percentile in Georgia. But that's more of a training through it type of thing.

I've chased dudes and my contact blurs out. I've run code to a med call and they blur out. I feel you. I do. But sometimes we have to accept our limitations for the sake of our lives or others.

Preface: I have mild irregular astigmatism so I always have at least a tiny bit blurring and double vision even at my best lens fitting. But it's gotten worse since my last eye exam in late 2018, so I did a home eye exam. My old rx: OD: -1 SPH, -1.5 cyl at 95 OS: -1.25 SPH, -1.25 cyl at 85 The home vision test Rx after repeating a few times: OD: -1.25 SPH, -2 cyl at 95 OS: -1.75 SPH, -1.5 cyl at 80 I was nervous about the home vision test, so I got trial lenses and watched about ten hours of video to learn how to subjectively refract myself. The new Rx is pretty close, and it's the closest I get to equal clarity on the duochrome test, but it's still pretty blurry and ghosting/doubled. My best vision seems to be slightly stronger than the home test Rx. This is what I got when I refracted myself: OD: -1.5 SPH, -2.25 cyl at 96 OS: -2 SPH, -1.5 cyl at 77 The duochrome test with this in my trial lenses is very slightly green, flipping to an almost unnoticeable red preference when I add +.25. I am 32. I know you're supposed to leave a younger patient on red, but do I still count as ""younger""<U+009D>? Is it okay to get the ones that look way clearer to me even though they're slightly higher? I know this is just for a prescription to get me through the next 3-6 months, but I did not like the weaker prescription at all due to the amount of ghosting and shadows and blurring. ",reddit,1,1

9734,"Hi all, I've been having quite a few issues with my left eye recently. Basically, when I was nine years old I accidentally stabbed myself in the left eye with a carving knife. Don't ask. It was dumb. I was incredibly lucky and was told I was literally millimetres away from blinding myself. It healed fine, and I just had to use eye drops for a couple of weeks. Now, flash forward to five weeks ago. I'm now 33yo and wear glasses. I have considerably worse vision in my left eye (I don't have my actual prescription to hand). Five weeks ago I woke up to find that I had floaters in my left eye. A dark line at the lower left hand periphery and a horseshoe shaped floater slightly off-centre at the top of my vision. The floaters didn't disappear for three weeks, and despite google and my boyfriend telling me that floaters were a normal part of ageing, something didn't feel right. Anyway (and stick with me here. I know it's getting convoluted). I went to the optician. He diagnosed me with a retinal tear and immediately sent me to A&E. the A&E doc wasn't sure whether he was seeing a retinal tear or my old injury, so he referred me to a consultant in the eye hospital. This consultant immediately diagnosed me with a retinal tear within 10 mins of looking on my eye. He even had a student doctor come in and take a look, and there was lots of talk about my ""retinal flap and how it looked like there was cigarette ash in my eye (rude). So I had laser retinopexy to fix the tear. And my vision has definitely improved. My horseshoe floater has definitely faded slightly and my dark peripheral vision seems to have come back a bit (not totally). Although I'm now getting a blur across the vision in my left eye multiple times a day (not constant blurred vision). Things seem to have improved though. Except, when I went for my checkup yesterday, a different consultant told me he can't see any tear within my eye, but he could see a lot of inflammation in the area that I'm seeing the dark line in my peripheral vision. He had two other consultants come in to look (the word granuloma was thrown around a lot), and then he told me he thinks I have ocular toxoplasmosis. I had an OCT scan, an eye ultrasound and bloods taken, and I'll apparently be seen within three days of my appointment (which was yesterday) to get the results and potentially begin treatment. But, guys, I am Freaking Out. The consultant was just woeful at giving me any real info on the condition, and everything I've found online is super filled with medical jargon. I just really need someone who has ocular toxoplasmosis to tell me what tf is going on. Halp. TLDR: i had laser eye surgery when I didn't need laser eye surgery, because I apparently don't have a retinal tear but I do have ocular toxoplasmosis. Wtf. ",reddit,1,1
9735,"Sorry I don't mean to sound like a dick but this is a common misconception. These are not 'your' measurements. I find people often get confused about this, saying things like 'I'm a 52' etc. The only way to find out if a frame fits is to try it on. Even understanding what the numbers mean isn't much help. For example, a frame with an 18 bridge may fit fine as a metal but as a thick acetate it may be far too small on your nose. A 140 side may be fine as a skull grip frame but not a hockey tip frame. Etc etc A frame might fit but might be too low/too high with reference to your eyebrows. Or it might touch your cheeks when you smile. Lots of little details that the measurements won't tell you. OK so if you have a notably large or small head you can look at the measurements and get an idea that something may be too small/too big. But otherwise you need to try them on. ",reddit,0,0

9750,Let me preface This and say I promise I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I wanted lasik my whole life and always heard such good things about it. I monitored friends and people in my own family for years to see the effects and everyone seemed alright. December 11 I made the worst decision of my life and had the procedure done. I went to the best doctor in Houston and for the newest wavefront Contoura technology done. Every day since I regret that decision. Please under stand there is a conspiracy from the Lasik industry and FDA to hide the true costs of Lasik. First there is no way for the doctor to truly know if you are a good candidate or not. They left form the procedure the same for everyone. Yes may be adjusted for near sighted/ farsightedness and astigmatism. But the doctors glaze over what they are really doing. Understand this when they make the incision on your flap whether blameless or with blade they are severing nerves on your eyes. Your eyes have the most nerves and most intense feeling of any place on your body. The doctors who cut nerves are not neurologist. They understand the surface or they eye and that's it. They expect the nerves will grow back perfectly but have NO way to know if and when and if something goes wrong they cannot see the nerves because they are microscopic. Please reeearch something called corneal neuralgia on YouTube and reddit as well as on google. It happens when the nerves on your eyes do not grow back correctly and you are left with chronic debilitating pain. There have been multiple people who commit suicide because the pain is so intense there are stories on google please search. Also when they cut your nerves they disrupt the cycle your eye has to keep the eye moist and safe. I understand you may think of dry eye as oh I will just put drops in. No! You could be left with sever dry eye that never goes away. Right now I am dealing with that. Doctors said I was perfect candidate and my eye would not have issues. The dry eye feels as if someone poured gasoline on my eyes and set it on fire. It feels this way constantly. I cannot even sleep because of the pain and there is no way to know if it's temporary. Please understand you have one set of eyes and if something goes wrong (it is not extremely rare there are hundreds of thousands of people who develop issues fro lasik some right after some 30 years later) there is no surgery to fix your eyes. They are ruined and destroyed and you will have to live with that forever. Knowing you chose that. Also FACT ppl who have lasik are at risk of developing cataracts up to 15 years earlier than normal. Not only that but your cataract surgery is more at risk of complication because of your mutilated cornea from lasik. Not only that you cannot even have the newest lens they use for cataract because of your mutiliated cornea. Is it really worth it? Would you be able to forgive yourself if something went wrong? It can happen at any time after lasik I have talked to people who get Weber dryness or pain or vision loss at 20 years after lasik? Please when you see scientist and top doctors are they not all wearing glasses?? Do not fall prey to the trap. Every day I convince myself to commit Suicide because my life has been stolen from me by lasik doctors. I had so many dreams but now I only exist so my family does not mourn me. I beg you to not make that mistake. I can prove everything I've told you if you want to know. Please go to lasikcomplications.com. Please listen to people who have had issues. Yes there are many ppl with no immediate problems but many develop them later and again there is no solution. Save yourself please. ,reddit,0,0

I try that prescription for about three weeks but I felt dizzy, got big headaches and didn't feel quite right. I went back to my optometrist and after much deliberation she agree to let me stay with my old prescription since I was seeing a little blurry from it, but I was still in the 20/20 range. Fast forward to February of this year I started to get big headaches on the right side of my head with eye pain and my vision was blurry while looking at far away. I couldn't read street signs anymore until I was closed to them. Naturally I went to see my optometrist again, she did all the test and was determine I had dry eyes, but everything else was find, she referred me to a dry eye clinic and that was the end of it. I wasn't able to get in to the dry eye clinic until the beginning of April. In the meantime the headaches, eye pain and blurry vision was still there. I went to two other optometrist and after performing all the test, the same diagnosis was giving that I had dry eyes and to wait for my appointment with the dry eye clinic. When I was finally able to be seeing at the clinic I was told I had MGD, but also I had bilateral anterior uveitis. I was treated with Lotemax at first for the uveitis, but the treatment didn't work and after two weeks the inflammation remain the same, so I was change to prednisolone every two hours with Timolol gel because I was a steroid responder. IOP before steroids was 10 in both eyes and IOP after steroids was L:17 R:21. Suffix to say after a month of treatment my optometrist try to temper me off the pred, but since she did it too fast my inflammation came back with a vengeance and my IOP shot up to L:25 R:36 and that was the highest it has ever got to. I was refer to an Uveitis specialist and I started seeing her at the end of May in the meantime I was told to continue using the pred every two hours and I was switch to Combigan to lower my IOP. The combigan kind of work because it did lower my IOP, but it was still high hanging at L:17 R:23 to 26 every time I was check. After seeing the specialist it was confirm I had anterior uveitis, but also intermediate uveitis. The inflammation has always been between a 0.5 to a 1 even when it was first discover so the Specialist was not to concern about it. She say I have a very mild case and all of my symptoms are due to my high IOP. She told me I could start tempering down from the pred and we start off with a very slow temper right now I'm currently using the pred 3 x a day with along with the Combigan drops and Dorzamilane to help lower my IOP. This past Monday during a follow up visit my Doc gave me the ok to get a new glasses prescription since everything look stable. She did mention I was a low risk glaucoma suspect giving my IOP was high for three months, but she told me she is not worry about it since an OCT test show everything was fine except for a C/D of 0.5 of both eyes which she thinks I was born with it like that. After the visit I have a habit of reading her notes in my chart and I found out I also have vitreomacular adhesion on both eyes, but she didn't mention, so I'm also looking for clarification on what exactly is that. I'm a 31 year old male who had never had any health problems before my uveitis. Every year I would get an eye exam and everything look good. I had been tested for everything under the sun, I had three MRI's and a ct scan that shows I'm perfectly healthy except for the fact I had Idiopathic Uveitis, I'm a glaucoma suspect and I had vitreomacular adhesion on both eyes. Yesterday, I finally went to get my eye exam and to my optometrist surprise I went from L:-2.25 Cyl:2.00 Axis:159 R:-2.75 Cyl:1.50 Axis:006 to L:-3.25 Cyl:1.25 Axis:165 R:-4.00 Cyl:1.50 Axis:006. I was surprised and worry at the same time so I asked her if it was normal to go up in prescription that quickly in under a year and her explanation was it could but that's it. Reddit I need your help because frankly I have a few questions about all of these that is happening to me. I have a extreme fear of going blind that gets worse with me having OCD. Is it normal to have big of a prescription change in less than a year? Could it be cause by all the drops I'm currently taking? What exactly is vitreomacular adhesion and is it dangerous? and Finally what can I do if anything to stop my prescription from changing or from developing Glaucoma from the steroid drops that I'm using at the moment? FYI: The inflammation is still there and it is stable at 0.5 the doc says it would remain there and hopefully in the near future it will go away on it's own since the steroids doesn't seem to be able to completely quiet my eyes down. The inflammation is too mild to try other medications because according to my doc the risk outweigh the rewards especially when my inflammation is this mild. Thank You. ",reddit,1,1

9764,"# Introduction Hi all, I'm a Chinese student studied in Germany currently. I have been disturbed by dry eyes syndrom from a very long time, 8 years approximately since I bought my first laptop. I work in the software industry. Needless to say, my daily screen time easily exceeds 8 hours. So, it's a simple truth that if you have dry eyes then quit facing screens for such a long time. Every doctor says that, and everyone knows that, but that's something out of our control. Computer is a productivity tool for people like me, I can't quit my job and go live in a mountain, right? I thought Asians are more prone to suffer from dry eyes, I once read a statistic report about that. Anyway, I'll just cut my crap and share what me (and people I know with similar problems) have already found out. # Diagnose ##. Self Diagnose First of all, you should know the current condition of your eyes. Here is a very simple way to diagnose yourself. According to severity of eyes' condition, the symptoms can be categorized into 3 levels: 1. Light: You can read real paper book (or newspaper, magazine, anything like that) for as long time as you want. You doesn't feel a thing while reading. But you eyes are feeling difficult while using a mobile phone or work in front of a screen monitor. 2. Medium: Hours of book reading make your eyes tired. Not to mention screen monitors. 3. Severe: Even openning your eyes is difficult. You want to secrete more tears but no, there is just no tears in eyes, not if you yawn or cry. You especially hate windy weather outside, because it leads to your sore and painful eyes. Guys, I'm not here to terrify you, there symptoms are what actually happened between us. And don't be desperate, I'm here to spread my experience. ## Hospital Diagnose You can also go to hospital, there are a bunch of machines made for this. I guess it won't costs much. In China, it costs roughly 50 dollars (Chinese yuan converted to USD). With the help of machines, you'll get a report and some data about your eye condition: 1. How long can your tear film lasts each time you close and reopen your eyes? 2. What is the amount of tear you have in your eyes? 3. Did you eye glands that secrete tears shrink or becoming distorted? These information is helpful, at least you need to know what happened to your eyes. Sorry for the amateur description, I'm not familiar with medical terms, especially in English. # Do's and don'ts ##. What to do? You can of course go to see the doctor, and often times you will have to try many doctors. In China, it seems that there is no mature way to cure dry eyes. What the eye doctor will do is let you try several kinds of eyedrops, and they often don't work well. Remember, if you are using any kind of eyedrops, just make sure they are absolutely preservative free. Also there are some mini-scale surgeries like SmartPlug and Lipiflow, they are quite more expensive than eyedrops. As far as I know these surgeries are not that helpful, but you can talk with your doctors and know more. I can roughly explain most of methods eye doctors would use, how does it work and why it's not so useful etc. But let's just move on to next paragraph, because I don't really have a positive attitude toward these methods. I don't know if there are different approaches used by doctors in western countries, so don't entirely take my words before ask the doctor for help. The most valuable thing you can do is to limit your screen time. I know there are factors other than screen that cause dry eyes, yes I know, but as long as you already have dry eyes symdrom then quit using screen should improve your condition instantly. The second valuable thing is doing exercises, outdoor exercises are better. The third is sleeping enough. Other things like quit masterbating or get some xanthophyll and eat fresh foods might help or might not, I don't know. Three things above are proved to work well. ## Don't do! 1. Don't use any screen or mobile phone in a dark room! 2. Don't get stick to the screen while your eyes are already shouting out loud: HELP! 3. Don't use any eyedrops contain preservative! 4. Don't try any eye surgeries before fully informed by doctors! # Silver bullet Is there a silver bullet, like it can cure it all? The answer is yes and no. ## Yes, there is a silver bullet Here comes the most important part of this post. A simple truth, what harms your eyes is the light source. It's not about the screen per se, it's the light source that lit the screen. So, if you are using kindle to read books, it should be quite comfortable for you eyes. Reading E-ink paper WITHOUT turning on its back light is just as reading real paper. What's the problem with iPhones, laptops, screen monitors? It's the LED inside the screen that harms our eyes. As far as I know there is only one another type of screen that doesn't have led: RLCD screens. RLCD screens are often used in outdoor advertisement. The problems with E-ink are the low refresh rate and limited color display. E-ink screen is just not acceptable if you are using it to work or do any kind of serious learning. What we have found out is to remove the LED inside the screen monitor and use natural light as the light resource to lit the screen. It's not easy to do, but you'll get familiar after you have one or two experience dismantling it. Not all screen monitors are good for this, make sure it uses a TN panel, not IPS, not VA, not OLED, it should be TN. TN panel has better transparency. Don't be scared, indoor lighting using LED won't harm, as long as the light doesn't directly shot into your eyes (like while you're using screens) then it should be fine. ## No, there is no silver bullet After you remove all harmful light source from screens, your eyes should make big improvement. But are they cured? Sorry, the answer is a no. For people have level 3 symptoms, you still need to rest your eyes as much as possible. I don't have a strict rule for everyone, just don't overuse it. Things like sleeping and doing exercises are big pluses to your eyes, things like overusing your eyes, especially using normal LED lit screens are big minuses to your eyes. Increase more pluses and decrease more minuses, then you should get through this fucking tricky disease, even WITHOUT using any drugs or surgeries. If your eyes just feel really dried up, you can use HYLO tear drop or use a hot towel to very lightly touch you eyes. --- Here we should put a period to this post, I think it's just already so long. I know there are many details I didn't expand into, so if you have any questions please leave comments below, I'll check regularly and see if I can help. ",reddit,0,0
9765,"Hello. My left eye sees worse than the right one and I barely see anything on computer screens without glasses. I'm using computers extensively. The thing with the left eye seeing worse is there because when I was little, I found a photo camera and played with the flash too much - it damaged my vision. If I don't use special computer glasses (expensive ones, with this violet-like glass), then my eyes get tired very quickly. It used to be so bad I couldn't look at a laptop without eye pain for more than 30 minutes. Nowadays it's not so bad when I use those glasses but I have to turn down the brightness nearly to a minimum. Do you think laser correction could help me with this issue with brightness? Or does it just improve how far I can see? I've already done some small surgery which helped me a little bit. I can try to find my diagnosis but basically the surgery was to fix these small ""snow drops"" that I see. Not sure how to explain. They had me looking at a dot and corrected my retina. ",reddit,0,0
9766,"I have struggled with insomnia for the last ten years, although it would be somewhat sporadic and especially get bad around my cycle. Through sleep hygiene and supplements I have had it mostly under control and slept well during 2020 when I was unemployed. However, now I am working full time (on the computer) and have been dealing with severe dry eye symptoms for the last 6 months, my sleep is absolutely wrecked. Especially in the last month. I only get 3 maybe 4 hours of sleep. Then I have middle of the night freakouts and I can't calm down. Because I know my body needs sleep in order for my eyes to heal. It's a viscous cycle. My normal sleep stack of mag glycinate, deep sleep herbal formula and melatonin just don't work anymore. Yesterday eve, I felt really calm. Had a nice yoga session after work, took a shower, made a cup of tea, listened to audio books. I felt calm and sleepy but when I try to sleep I get these surges of adrenaline my skin feels hot and rubbery. I've also been doing sleep restriction technique which had worked well for me in the past but not anymore. Does anyone know of any Rx medications to help you sleep or calm an anxiety attack that dries out eyes the least?

9767,"Yes, he also said the same - that he hasn't seen any patients or heard of the vaccine possibly causing this. He did say that he has heard of cases where people developed this condition after contracting COVID-19.

9770,"I have dealt with redness in the eyes ever since I was 18. I am now 36. I used to see it in both eyes, but the last few years I have only had it in my right eye. It's only on the exposed cornea on the inside corner of my eye, but sometimes it'll be red on the outside. It does seem like that eye is dryer than the other, but I only have very mild discomfort and it doesn't itch. I normally wouldn't post on here, but I have literally seen countless eye doctors over the years. Every visit turns out the same. They do a thorough exam and find no signs of infection or any issues whatsoever. So each one gives up and prescribes something like Zylet or Alrex. I usually use it for a few days only and symptoms disappear for months then eventually come back. Most doctors assume it's some allergy. I've tried changing soaps, detergents, everything. Being outside seems to make it better some. Lubricant drops help for a few minutes but no more. I've tried fish oil, multiple diet changes, and anything I could think of. It definitely seems worse the less sleep I get. If I can get a ridiculous amount of sleep, like 10 hours, it almost completely goes away, but that's near impossible to get that much sleep.

9778,"I don't want to overwrite your doctor, especially because I'm a 3rd year student and absolutely lack the expertise he/she has. Here is my opinion nonetheless... And it would be easier to give you an answer if you specified which eye was feeling these effects... the right one, or both? I'm guessing it's just the right eye thats giving you trouble, yes? If not, disregard the rest... For an eye with +6.50 - 0.50 x 120 ...I probably wouldn't even touch that cyl and just give you the sphere (like your doctor did). But if you *do* in fact need it, then my next guess would be that the lens is rotating on your eye. Every time you blink, the contact lens' ballast/orientation mechanism is rotating it to the correct axis, and then it drifts off again a second or so later. This is probably super difficult, but if you have a magnifying glass (and a flashlight) and you have really keen sight, try to find that inferior marking on your contact lens while wearing it in front of a mirror. See if it isn't in the same spot right after blinking, and a few seconds later. A total longshot, but can't hurt to try. If you're committed to having contact lenses and can't get any soft ones to work, then you can always try RGPs. ",reddit,0,0

I would say 95% if its not 100% yet. 2. One side-effect that I still have is haze. Nothing extreme but noticeable in certain conditions with high contrast. It's only been 3 months but im hoping the haze goes away in due time. 3. Also I noticed starbursts coming from light sources, I'm hoping this goes away as well. 4. Dryness has gotten better and I've been using less drops as the months go by. So overall, vision is not bad at all, but some slight haze that I'm praying goes away in time, if anyone else has experience with CXL and can comment on the haze please let me know if I should be worried.

9781,"To start out I am 32 and have never had glasses before. I had 20/15 vision prior to being dilated. I recently found out I am hyperopic and need a prescription of +6 in my left eye and +3 in my right eye. My optometrist opted to start out with glasses approximately half strength. I ended up getting fitted for +2.5 and +1. I know it takes a while to adjust to glasses but I am always dizzy if I'm moving and get nauseous pretty easy, especially if I'm looking around at things (ie grocery shopping). My distance vision is definitely worse than it used to be. I have a fish lense view and I struggle to change my focus from near to far and vice versa. I'm wondering how long is normal to wait for things to level out? Could it possibly be that my eyes want to fully relax and I should up my prescription or is it because it was a big jump from nothing? Also, when I take my glasses off to shower I loose my balance because one eye can accommodate again and one is blurry, haha does this level out? Thanks for the help!

I notice however that I'm usually under-corrected for distance. As these are progressive glasses, this is apparent by looking at distance through a lower area in my glasses. Just curious if there's anything I can say to an optometrist at next appointment to avoid this scenario from happening again in the future, as this is the 2nd occurrence. i.e. is it possible or even advisable to just add another +0.25 to distance, both eyes??

9791,"Around 3 years ago, I saw a ""flash"" in my left eye. This was on the right side of my left-eye's field of vision, about half-a-centimetre to the right from the centre of the Amsler Grid and, and maybe 1/4 of a centimetre down. When this calmed down a bit, it became a bit like a camera flash after-image which didn't go away, so I went to Specsavers and was referred to the eye unit at a nearby hospital. They performed the full range of scans; a visual field test, something which involved laser-scanning my retina, simply looking at the problem with my eyes dilated... As I was in my mid-30s, the doctor was really trying to convince me this problem was a floater, but I was pretty sure it wasn't as the problem was ""fixed"" (it moved in perfect tandem with the movement of my eye, no drift). Still, the nature of the tests they did meant they strongly believed I hadn't suffered a retinal tear or detatchment. After much examination, the doctor said they believed I was suffering from a mild form of PVD, and that I should keep aware of it and only come back if the problem got worse. They said I should avoid anything which would ""jar"" my head for a few months, so stuff like intense exercise or rollercoasters and the like, but that I should expect this as I got older, and it *should* get better over time (though could take months). It's now maybe 3 years later, and I can still see the mark in my eye. It's definitely less noticeable than it once was (like I have to drift my eye across the correct light conditions to see it, like if I drift it over the scrollbar at the edge of a computer screen) and it has become smaller, but it's still there - and it hasn't really changed since maybe a year after it first appeared. I had a scare recently where I saw another mark in the same eye, but I'm having sinus pains after a recent bout of flu and fortunately this didn't stay. Still, it's made me super-conscious of this. However, when I look up PVD symptoms online, such as here... [https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/posterior-vitreous-detachment](https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/posterior-vitreous-detachment) ... they generally say that PVD symptoms should pretty much disappear within a few months, and this has remained. I can live with it, but it's really annoying. Sometimes I'm reading text and my eye is drawn to it, like it looks like a letter further along the page is smudged. I write as a major part of my profession so you can see why this might be irritating. It's also worrying living with the constant fear of it getting worse. I get nightmares of waking up one morning and my whole vision is covered in them. Anyway, if anyone can offer advice, I'd much appreciate it.

9792,"Hi all, I found out in March that I have Keratoconus (one of my parents does as well) after my vision in my right eye drastically reduced over the past year and I went to the eye doctor to get a new glasses prescription (I'm in my late 20s). The eye doc was unable to get me back to 20/20 vision even with lenses, but I feel pretty lucky that I can see/read fairly well still, at least during the day. However, I've noticed my vision get worse even just since March. I wonder if the increased amount of screen time from working from home, etc. during quarantine could have played a role?

I’m glad I am on my way to change and I am actively working on myself but I can’t help but wish I sought a therapist sooner.",reddit,1,1
12003,"Social Anxiety, Hairloss and taking control of life - So here I am again, sitting in front of the computer: red eyes, tired as hell and not in the mood to do anything. It has been like this for the last few days. I have been practicing mindfulness for almost half a year now, and slowly it seemed it was starting to help with my social anxiety. Sometimes I could feel ok with being physically uncomfortable. I thought I was finally going to win this battle, life wouldn't be so hard after all.   But when things started to look better it happened... My hair started falling. Gradually, it started to show. I take a shower and I see hairs on the drain, I pass my hand through my head and I get a few hairs on my hand. My pillow is also not a good sight. Shedding everywhere... While my hairline remains exactly the same, my hair is diffused all over the top of my head. I can still look like I have a full head of hair when it's long, but I have cut it short last week and my scalp is visible under lights. I can't tell you how crappy I feel when I look in the mirror and see my scalp, such a terrible vision. I am 22 years old, this is no age to be balding...   So basically I have been struggling with this. I went to a dermatologist who said I was balding and prescribed me Finasteride and Minoxidil. The first one can cause erectyle dysfunction, depression and other terrible things, so I wrote it off immediately. The second  one is a liquid that needs to be applied twice a day to be (possibly) effective. It stimulates hair growth but it doesnt really stop the hairloss, and you have to do it forever. Once you stop, you lose all the hair you gained. Plus, it causes dandruff and can cause face swelling and heartbeat raising. So I really haven't made the decision to go down this route or not. I could shave my head, but it would be quite a shock and I am afraid of what it will do to my anxiety...  I am not being able to cope with this. I have been binging through the internet to find information about hairloss and coping with it, but if possible I got even more lost... I tend to do this when I get down, I start searching obsessively about my situation only to find contradicting and excessive information, leading to burnout and frustration. Instead of trying to distract myself and do something different, I just stay at home and ""disappear"" for a few days, avoding any plans that could take me out of my comfort zone, trying to fool myself that I am pulling myself back together and will come back stronger. I just find it so hard to take control of my life, to live in the present.   I always think that tomorrow will be better and that someday, somewhere else, I will achieve my goals. But I just feel so empty right now... Today I refused an invitation to a party and didn't leave the house at all. I feel once again back to square one... And it is hard to grind through these moments and to start all over again. It is hard to feel over and over again that all my progress is gone, that I am once again lonely, carrying all my fears and anxieties against the world, when all I really want is to feel surrounded by friends whom I can call and hangout whenever I want, and to find a loving girlfriend. But that just seems so distant..  Any thoughts on this? Anyone experiencing something similar? How do you grind through these moments? How do you build a routine and stick to it no matter what, to achieve your goals? And for anyone dealing with baldness how do you cope with it? Does meditation help?",reddit,1,1
12004,"I finally accept it. I have debilitating social anxiety. - My whole entire life I've struggled with feelings of inadequacy, overwhelming fear of judgement , harsh and unrealistic self criticism, self loathing etc. I didnt become awkward socially until i was about 14. Around this time i developed extreme BDD and anxiety eventually leading me to drop out of high school. Now looking back at it, i wish i wouldve gotten some help and spoken up about it all instead of making the decisions i made. Im 22 years old and treated like a child by my family members...i know its because i havent proven that i can be independent or self sufficient. Ive never had a job and the one time that i did, i quit after a month because i overheard a co-worker talking about how awkward i was. How do you even begin to get out of a situation like this?...i feel like im disabled in some ways..like im stuck like this...im currently trying to look for jobs and get on my feet and prove to myself that i can do this but because of my lack of experience...im getting nothing. Im just literally done with this shit. I have conversations with my sibilings who are literally the only people i feel the least bit comfortable around and when i start to open up to them they always say ""Wow, youre smarter that I thought!"" Its like are you kidding me?..ive always done pretty well in school and i feel like i present myself in a way where i dont look like an idiot but i guess people equate quiteness and shyness to stupidity.

12005,"A tip from me who has a job interview and teacher meeting tomorrow (and social anxiety) - I have had severe social anxiety my whole life (I am 20). I can relate to every post on this subreddit same as you probably do.         I am also going to see an old teacher tomorrow and then I have a job interview afterwards. I have been on the brink of a panic attack all weekend. My stomach is in knots and I can feel my heart beating faster and faster.         My concerns aren’t new, it’s things like being scared of saying the wrong thing, scared I won’t know how to answer the questions or scared that I will stutter, shake, and turn red. The teacher I’m going to see I haven’t seen in over a decade, so I’m scared of what it’ll be like and how the conversation will flow.         —how I get through it—      I keep repeating “this too shall pass”       I know that no matter what happens, I will be at home in a few hours lying in my bed and eating some good food. Everything will be over and I will have a huge sense of relief and calmness.         I have gone through numerous stressful experiences in the past few years and even if I feel like an absolute failure afterwards, it’s ok, because I don’t have to see those people again. It also doesn’t really get easier, I just know what to expect.  ",reddit,1,1
12006,"I feel like I've wasted my entire life doing nothing because of my anxiety. No, I have wasted it. - I'm 16 and I've never had any real friends, and whenever I was starting to develop friendships with people my anxiety would shut that down instantly and make it incredibly difficult for me to talk to them.  I stopped going to school at age 13 because of my anxiety, I was constantly getting panic attacks and cold sweats, I couldn't focus on my work and everything scared me. This got my parents into a lot of legal trouble, and it seriously hurt my relationship with them, but I couldn't take school anymore, it was way too much and I wanted to do anything but school.  I wish I could go to school without anxiety, I love talking to people and being with people I love, but my anxiety won't let me, all I can do is fantasize about that.  I'm at the point where I've lost all hope, I feel as if nothing will ever change. My daily routine is just me dicking around online and I'm sick of it, it's so boring, but I have nothing else to do. My anxiety is everywhere, I can't get rid of it no matter how hard I try.  I've talked about this with my psychologist (I think that's what they're called? The mental health version of a GP) but I find it really hard to talk about any of my problems there, they just run down a list of questions then end it.   ''have you had any bad or suicidal thoughts lately? How have you been? So no changes? OK, see you next month''. It's pretty much that, I don't really have a chance to say what I want because I'm getting rushed to finish. I've mentioned smaller thing like ADHD and stuff but he didn't really help me with that much. So I don't see asking for help as much of an option, I also don't want my parents to find too much out about myself because it would probably worsen our relationship more.  What is there to do anymore, I don't feel like there's anything I can do now, I have no control. I don't want to keep living like this, it's so boring and my emotions have gone numb. I seriously don't want to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing I've done yesterday, I'm so sick of it...  If I told my doctor any of this, he'd have to tell my parents, if my parents found out I'm depressed and suicidal and have crippling anxiety they'd treat me with even less respect than they do now, I'm considered a failure, and I agree that I am one, I just don't want them to have more reason to tell me how much I fucked up my life and how ill never have another chance in life.

12008,"The reason i'm scarred - I don't know if anybody will care for this story or even if what i'm going to say is allowed.   But i was married once. The only reason i ever found someone was because they found me. It was someone i worked with. I wasn't 100% attracted to this person, but someone out there wanted me. I think i even turned her down at first, but then i started to see her differently and we started going out. I was also sick of living at home and wanted out so i moved in with her. Everything happened so fast. We moved to another state and got married way too fast.   But i had a problem, that i still have today. I sometimes have trouble (cough cough) getting off, even if i'm just masturbating. I still don't know what causes it. My doctor has no answers either. But my wife was not helpful at all when it happened. Not at all. Most times she would say stupid stuff like, it's me isn't it, you don't find me attractive enough. That just made things worse. And it wasn't always that. Some things would help it happen but she wasn't helpful in doing those things. Besides my problem, we were incompatible. The things she said to me made me not even want to have sex with her anymore. Then i got a computer (back in the early days of the internet) and i got addicted to it and stopped paying attention to her and then eventually she asked for a divorce.   Now besides having severe social anxiety i have always had a fear of hooking up with someone because of my problem, what if it happens again. I feel like i'd have to explain my whole life story to someone before i could hook up with anybody. I'm too afraid. It's going on 20 years since then and i barely leave the house.

12010,"I feel extremely out-of-my depth among the upper class in an Asian country. You guys have experience with that ""big small town"" feeling and adults who gossip like high schoolers? I'm 22 and new to this. - TL;DR: jumping into a new social class in a new location is stressful  I'm in Myanmar. Arriving here, my initial goal was to settle by making local friends and I find them consistently chill and approachable. Meanwhile, the expats are probably a little friendlier than average in North America; they're well-travelled and educated people.  Among the expats, the lowest social status are transient English teachers and NGO workers. Then there are the corporate managers and diplomats, mostly European and worldly. Startup and entrepreneur foreigners are increasingly common and I am one. The trouble is that, at this stage, I'm making less money than even the English teachers.   Among the local young people, the wealthier are the most westernized. Typical locals want to be friends with foreigners but the rich kids are like foreigners in their own country. I'm having a fling with one of these internationally-schooled locals, getting a look into the ""expat scene"", and a number of things are stirring up anxiety. In Canada I was comfortably middle-class in a city of 1 million people and I'd never experienced anything like ""high school drama"" or whatever prepares you for this type of environment. For example:  1) I don't have the money to keep up with the high society's nightclubs and weekend getaways. I'm always declining invitations so that I can chill with local friends but I actually could not afford to do anything else. 2) The first couple people I slept with here have seemingly been with every white guy in town. I've never even hooked up with anyone with mutual friends before. 3) I had a 5-hour friendly visit with a foreign girl who's been here 7 years; she spilled quite a bit of gossip about various prominent people then blocked+ghosted me afterwards and I've not seen her since.  4) My friend is pursuing this guy who was my girlfriend's high school crush; he's organized various parties and has never acknowledged my existence when I've tried to introduce. 5) I sometimes comment helpful info on questions in the local Expats' Facebook groups, maybe once per week and multiple strangers have recognized my name. 6) When a wealthy half-white guy heard I was dating my girl, he remarked that I look like ""one of those nobodies who'd move across the world to Asia just to feel important"". Not super personal, that could be said about almost anyone here, but it still hits close to home lol.  You guys have any stories or tips to offer about moving to a new place?

12014,"Advice in regards to my bf - I've (22f) been with my bf (24m) for 3 years, we'll call him John. We are both a bit socially awkward and depressed. Tbh my shyness is a worse than his but he seems to have worse luck with friendships.   He recently made a new friend at work, after having social issues at various jobs for years due to essentially just not really clicking with anyone. He's not boisterous or obnoxious in any way, he has a few interests but is generally pretty withdrawn and stoic.   Anyway, we recently hung out with this new friend together. Everything seemed fine, it was me, him, his friend (we'll call him Tim) and Tim's best friend. We were more on the quiet side and Tim and his friend were more energetic than us. I thought that was pretty normal especially if you're hanging out with two people who have been really close friends for years. Fast forward to 4 days later, John is at work and Tim comes in because they work together, and all of a sudden Tim is acting different and not really going out of his way to approach John anymore.  Tim was joking around and talking a lot more to the other coworker instead of my John.   &amp;#x200B;  So John comes home on his work break, distraught and crying because he thought he finally made a friend at a job but now after hanging out Tim seeps super disinterested in pursuing the friendship further.   I tried to comfort him by telling him that it isn't a reflection of his flaws and that sometimes people just aren't compatible as friends, much like dating. He's not really hearing it though and says he doesn't really want to live anymore because he's tired of being so dislikable and not having friends.  I'm trying really hard to be supportive and let him know that it's not the end of the world but I realize how hurtful this situation is. I understand his sensitivity regarding it, I've been there, I've just sort of reached a place of acceptance that I'm generally different but that it's ok.  &amp;#x200B;  Can anyone please give me some ideas on how I can be more supportive and maybe some wise words of advice?

I'm horrible at talking to people, getting to know them, making them feel good, making myself seem interesting, making genuine connections, etc. I basically black out and forget to do/say even the most basic things like introducing myself. I live in the heart of a city, in college, consistently flooded with Tinder/Bumble/OkCupid matches, always complimented on my looks, and surrounded by people everywhere I go like on the subway, on campus, and the office, so knowing what my life COULD be like bums me out because I'm just wasting all this opportunity. You'd think with all those things on my side I'd have no problem, but the problem is me. I'm afraid to initiate conversations in person, and the rare times I do it pretty much bombs and gets awkward pretty quickly. I just feel so ""alone in a crowded room"" all the time.      How can I get out of this rut and thrive in social situations? It's not even just people I'm attracted too, it's pretty much anyone, any age, any gender. I think it's talking to someone, one on one, that's the worst for me because I have to be 100% engaged and the spotlight is on me which makes me uncomfortable. I do a little better in small groups of 3-4 people because there's less pressure on me to keep things moving. What can I do to build confidence and not panic when speaking with someone? I know it takes practice, but I need more advice than ""just go out and talk to people!""",reddit,0,0

12025,"My Life with Social anxiety - hello. My name is Nicholas. I am 14 years old. In this story I would like to tell you about my life with  social anxiety (self diagnosed). It all started when I started school. I always wondered why people didn't like me, and people would always reject me. As I went further up in primary school, I always used to get comments like, ""why are you so weird"" , ""why are you so anxious"" etc. Not only did this make me feel worse, but it made my social anxiety worse. People would always take my anxiety in the wrong way, and rejected me. Then I went to high school (year 7). I thought it would be nice to try a fresh start at a new school, but the problem didn't improve. It only got worse. I always felt like i was barely clinging onto the social circle, and finding interests to mix with them would not only be very difficult, but stressful. Two years later (now/ 2018) , I woke up. I became more aware about what was happening in my life. I wanted CHANGE. I didn't want that same old, boring life I had lived all my life. What I wanted was friends. Did you hear that? friends? My wanting of change started (at the beginning of this year) , not doing much but making me more anxious and depressed than ever before. i could easily say that this year has been the worst year of my life. It was when I started to discover this ""thing"" called social anxiety, which was just a bit more than being extremely shy. I have started to see a psychologist, but he hasn't helped that much so far. I don't know If I should say this, but I am starting to have suicidal thoughts. I really don't know what to do with my life anymore. I am typing this post in hope, that someone will see this, and comment, and maybe make my day. I just want to know that there are people out there that may be able to give me the slightest, tiniest bit of hope.",reddit,1,1

For ages I was excited, because it might give me a chance to make up for lost time in my teenage years. It sounds bad, but I was also hoping that I could drink to hide my anxiety.  But on the day, I was really nervous. I had to go, it was my friend's 18th.  There weren't many people there, but I was instantly anxious. Another problem is that my friend's mum had helped choose the guest list, so there were adults there too (including old teachers).

Plus, I'm French and they only spoke English : I could speak English ""in my mind"" and I had a very good level, but I could never say anything out loud because I was afraid of having an accent or making mistakes.   I was constantly in my mind the whole time trying to analyze everything. Can I just say hi or should I shake hands ? Do I look confident even though I'm having the worst time of my life ?

Whenever I'm around people, I just stay silent because I'm too nervous to speak/afraid of saying something wrong. Sometimes I'm aware I am being quiet, but sometimes I swear I forget it's 'normal' to make conversation with friends, family and colleagues.  If anyone could leave any helpful tips about maintaining conversation, that would be great!  Also, for people in the UK - How do you respond when someone says 'you alright?'. Should I say 'yes thanks' and ask about the other person? If someone says 'you alright?' in passing (e.g. when passing an acquaintance in the street or a colleague in the corridor), should I answer 'yes', or should I say 'you alright' back to them?

Classmates would actively avoid touching me and I dreaded every day at PE where I had to show my skin. Even now I avoid wearing shorts and t-shirts. I remember making resolutions to make tons of friends and join clubs every new year of school but it never happened. Now I'm in college pursuing a degree but my life is so empty. I do nothing but study and watch anime brainlessly everyday. I used to have a couple of friends that was really close to but they have long since moved away. I feel like I've lost who I was and forgot what its like to live. I don't know why I should make friends anymore. What is the appeal in it? Every time I interact with someone I am anxious and on edge. I keep worrying what I am saying isn't enough or sufficient in some way and come off as rude or selfish.

She’s previously disclosed to me that she gets very anxious texting people back. It was common in our relationship that I wouldn’t hear from her for a week or so and we had an understanding that I’d keep sending her messages when I’m thinking of her, memes, funny stories, etc. without the expectation for her to respond to each one.  About a year ago I noticed the time in between her texts getting longer and longer but knew she was going through some stuff with the pandemic - her biggest red flag that something is wrong is when she doesn’t text back.  Now, this current streak is the longest I’ve ever not heard from her… It’s been over 8 months. Throughout this time I’ve text her between a few times per week to a few times a month, however, after a couple months I was getting worried and reached out to our other friends to see if they’d heard from her. I found out they hadn’t and they were also worried so I reached out to her sister who confirmed she was going through a rough time and was distant with everyone. I reached out to her sister again, who seems to be her biggest support, and her sister told me that she (my friend) feels very guilty for not responding and has said she doesn’t deserve to have friends like us. This breaks my heart. I also recently reached out to my friends long time partner to check in and he seemed very oblivious and unhelpful which makes me worried about the role he plays in her health.   I’m currently seven months pregnant. I’ve been sending my friend texts and updates but I’m getting discouraged and honestly feeling hurt that I haven’t heard from her.

I have very very fair skin to make it extra noticeable, and I'm a guy also (less socially ok as it's a feminine trait). And it's psychosomatic because the fear of blushing in itself causes blushing. Even though I've tried exposing myself to society a lot over the past 6 months, it hasn't helped it whatsoever. When I get upset by it my muscles tighten and my eyes water along with it. I know it pulls a lot of attention. And there's no rationalizing it.   In CBT they try to tell you (essentially) ""it's all in your head"".

I've always been terribly shy, but what was cute as a kid is now something very embarrassing. I interned for a year and during all of it I couldn't feel completely at ease with my coworkers. They were a small and tight knit friendly group, and I felt I missed out on being closer to them. I made up in my lack of social skills by bringing cakes and pies I make, a reminder that I wasn't an asshole, just shy.  Even then, to be in these gatherings on the back of the office, I would feel extremely uncomfortable. People even commented on it, making motions with their shoulders, that I could relax. During these my body would literally freeze. Before I knew it I was holding my shoulders high, retracting as far as I could. I would always excuse myself quickly, but I wish I would instead stay and talk with everyone.  I feel so angry at myself for not being able to have normal interactions with people. I don't know how to explain it, but my voice sounds sort of muffled, and people often don't understand what I say. Which then makes me stutter and get caught up in the words. I hate the sound of my voice, specially when I'm nervous. Most of the time people can't hear me, specially in groups settings, half because I speak mumbling and half because they didn't expected me to say anything. Sometimes in college people would talk over me and not even realize, it was awful. Sometimes I think people must think I'm ""special"" because of how I act in public.

12093,"I really need to get a job but my last job experience was awful. - So, here goes a bit of background. I'm a 19 year old college student and I would really like to start paying off my tuition. I've been seeing a therapist for like a year. I worked as a cashier at a grocery store for like 2 yrs and a half and it was a horrible experience. I have a problem that stems from my anxiety where I can't control my facial expressions and I often look pissed off. I literally could not go a day at work without overhearing someone talking shit about me or just saying it to my face. One of my coworkers even called me a crackhead at one point. Another called me crazy. One time, some old white woman I was ringing up literally started to laugh hysterically at me when she noticed my odd facial expressions. Two of my coworkers who bagged for me would always laugh at me. Many of the other baggers would literally just avoid me by always bagging for another cashier. All in all, people avoided me like the plague if they could. It's not even like I'm ugly or anything because I'm pretty attractive. A lot of women have attempted to talk to me but when I do weird shit with my face they just back off. It's just that my facial expressions steer people away and because it happens so frequently, I don't have much confidence. So with all that being said, I'd like to get a job again because I need the money. I really would like to work a electronics retail store or a restaurant, but if I do end up applying to either, I'm afraid I'm going to experience the same miserableness and humiliation I had at my last job due to their social nature. What do I do? I really need to start attacking this issue now because if I don't it's just going to catch up to me when I graduate and pursue my career. ",reddit,1,1
12094,"I felt very alone and awkward in high school as well. I was quiet and went to private school my whole life up until 10th grade when I decided to go to public school, which terrified me. All of the other girls seemed to have perfect skin and straight hair, whereas I had acne and a thick, wavy mane of hair I was embarrassed about. As I got older, I realized how much hormones controlled not only my acne, but more than likely my outlook and behavior as well. I’m now 25 years old and although I still struggle with social anxiety and feeling awkward on a very regular basis, I have grown a lot more comfortable in my skin. Sometimes I surprise myself with how little I care; other times, I know I care too much and need to come back down to earth.   The point is, once you’re out of high school, you may still feel uncomfortable at times, but I think it opens your eyes to how little others are paying attention to you. Most people are too busy worrying about what other people will think of them. High school is more challenging because you’re surrounded by so many people in your age group all day, as well as the work you mentioned.

It was my worst year BY FAR. I'm in my mid 20's now, still have anxiety, but without much effort it dramatically improved simply by getting older and naturally having responsibilities thrown at me.   I still like reading through these subs as they're often comforting and funny, and you occasionally get a good piece of advice on here, but trust me when I say that the sharp edges of anxiety soften naturally with age and experience.   The future is bright in a way as we're both lucky to be part of a generation that - as a whole relative to previous generations - is very open-minded, self-aware, open to talk about mental illness and self-deprecating. Although it's shit now, take comfort in that there's a lot of improvements being made for those who suffer with anxiety and depression nowadays, and you're at the perfect age to start feeling the benefits of it.

12105,"Wow, this is actually really inspirational for me. I’m super happy for you after all this effort you can live your life.  If you don’t mind I’ll explain what exactly my problems are and how they are started. It may be long. I don’t know if you take the time for it, but if you do I would appreciate it a lot, because the things you wrote are super inspirational. My english ain’t the greatest, but I would do my best to make things as clear as I can.    I’ve had a rough childhood. I had no safe home due of mental and physical abuse for around 8 years since I was 5. When I finally had a safe home my confidence was down to zero. I’ve literally escaped to another city with my family. I felt like I had no change to develop myself normally. I was exposed to things children doesn’t need to exposed to at that age. Anyway, I knew it wasn’t normal, but I tried to move on.   When I was around 15 I experimented with drugs and alcohol. Such a stupid choice when your already feeling bad and insecure about yourself. In a lot of social situations I turned in myself. People called me quite all the time and I felt different then everyone else. That was painful because it followed me in every social situation. I just didn’t know what to say, because I think I wasn’t recovered from what I’ve already gone through. My family didn’t accept me because I was so introvert. High school was a disaster. I got bullied by my own ‘friends’ (yeah, that’s possible). Some how against all expectations I managed finish high school.   I went to college and slowly I felt my bucket of water was running over. One day I smoked weed before class and I had my first anxiety attack. It was horrible and terrifying. I was too afraid to take the bus so I walked to my home for around 4 hours. I ignored it completely. I had experience kinda anxiety attacks with weed before. When it was summer I decided to try magic mushrooms with my friends. They took it, so I thought I would be fine. Everything went in such a quick rush. It was a impulsive decision. I still regret it. I experienced my 2nd major anxiety attack. It was horrible. Especially the first hour of the trip I couldn’t accept it and I felt the most uncomfortable you could imagine.   Months later I experienced anxiety more and more. Also when I was sober. I started to get hyperventilation and at that point, my life completely went down the hill. I started to get intense fears of being in places I couldn’t leave. Especially social situations. For months I tried to get back to school. I was cycling to school day after day and I was too afraid to get inside. Anxiety for a panic attack was the thing that was destroying my life.   I started to get help. I thought I was on the right place, but after a year I actually noticed I wasn’t. They weren’t specialized in anxiety problems. It did help me a bit. I even went to Spain and I actually break through a lot of fears those 2 weeks, but also I walked against my anxiety at some point. Overall it was a hopeful little period of time. I was completely breaking my social anxiety fears. I was talking to strangers and I felt good and I enjoyed it. Anyway, when it was over, my anxiety slowly returned. (I think) because of my bad experiences with drugs I developed fear for alcohol, coffee and medicine as well. My therapist noticed it as well and at one day she said it wasn’t go to work out, so they decided to let me go.   After that, I became in a gap. My fears increased. I developed more fears I already had. I started to avoid more and more. Taking the train and bus wasn’t possible anymore. Doing groceries wasn’t possible anymore. Especially doing it alone was becoming impossible. I managed to go with someone, but after a while that wasn’t possible either. I couldn’t get my hair cut anymore. I couldn’t hang out with my friends anymore. I couldn’t see my family anymore.   All of this slowly developed in 1 year till now. At the moment I can’t even open my door anymore. I still live at my moms house and I actually have no responsibilities at all. My fears are literally in everything now. I can’t watch a movie, because I will fear I lose control and do something evil. I’m extremely alert and anxious for ‘evil’ things and it’s ridiculous. Even my hobby; making music, is affected because of it. I can’t open my front door anymore, because my social anxiety feel completely overwhelming. If my mom or my sister is away and I’m alone I feel kinda paranoid. Which is something I am fearful for that I have. I feel in constant battle with my thoughts. I am constantly afraid of losing control. That I’ll snap and do something incredibly stupid. I’m even fearful of myself. I feel like I have to be constantly alert and it actually goes automatically. I’m fearful of psychoses. Anything that is a little ‘trippy’ freaks me out. Till not long ago I was taking walks everyday, but since that is gone I feel incredibly bad. I feel like I kinda lost myself. I don’t who I am under this anxiety. That’s freaks me out, because I don’t know if it’s any good. I’m depressed out the future. I totally not feel connected with the world. Physically as well(hard to explain). I just feel completely out of place. Everything is just negative. Constantly.  Because it’s 24/7 I wonder if this is just GAD, social anxiety and depression. It makes me insecure. I’m afraid to expose myself outside of my home. I believe I was born more shy and thoughtful then a regular person, but if I haven’t go through all of this I don’t think I would have suffer this much. I was afraid to sleep alone till an age of 15 for example and I still don’t feel comfortable being alone. I’m 20 years old btw, so I probably have quite some time ahead of me.. And yeah, depressed about the future. I don’t see me having a girlfriend, traveling, partying, working, going to school or just having fun in general at all anymore.",reddit,1,1

And if you’ve never been in a relationship it’s highly likely there’s a side to you that you don’t recognize until you are with another person.   The better you understand yourself the better it’ll be to communicate with another person. As for looks, don’t worry about it too much. Confidence does go a long way.

For a long time I thought there was no way, as I like meeting new people and spent alot of time in theatre in highschool in lead roles. I'm the funny guy in groups.  But then I get into one on one situations. And in these I can be with my closest friend that I've known for years and not be able to talk to them. No topics come to mind, I just blank.  This makes talking to girls really hard, as you might imagine.  It has gotten to the point where I'll avoid one on one situations at all costs.  I'm a 20 year old adult and I can't hold a conversation.  That's the part that's always dwelled in the back of my mind.  But there were 2 catalyst events that led to me posting here.  The first is that I was at a Christmas Party this last holiday season, and there were alot of people at this college house. I had never dealt with that dense of a surrounding of people for such a long time before and after a few hours I found a corner where nobody could see me and started crying. And I don't know why.  That was terrifying.  The second event is that I started watching the office.  I cannot watch more than 3 episodes a day because there's always some point where Michael Scott does some horribly cringy social thing and I realize that's how I would have dealt with the situation too.  The way he talks to girls he likes is spot on with how awkward and difficult it is for me to do.  The way he tries so hard and gets so excited just about making one friend.  Or the way he ""fangirls"" over a person that he wants to be friends with.  All of this hits me way too hard to keep watching.  And on top of that I don't feel like I have any real friends.  The person I'm closest with is a girl who is my roommate, but I'm so close with her because I was/am in love with her for over a year and I didn't know how to tell her.  I only told her about a week ago how I felt about her but she doesn't feel the same way. I told her I would get over it and not to worry and things are going back to normal between us but I don't think I can just move on.  Also, I made the brilliant decision to move in with her while these feelings were developing and we're signed up to live together next year already.  The most frustrating part is I attempt to be the happy go lucky guy around everyone I know because that's all I've ever been: The Upbeat Clown. And I don't know who I am without that, it's my identity. So i just keep up that face regardless of how much I want to cry sometimes.  Please someone tell me something I can do.

I'm a 22 male who hasn't even kissed a girl. To add on to that, I have a hard time developing feelings for anyone and when I even show the slightest interest I will analyze the scenario to rationalize me remaining distant and not pursuing my desires. I have a hard time displaying affection. Even though I tell myself that this isn't because I fear getting hurt, I'm starting to slowly realize that it's exactly that.   This is such a problem that I even rejected my best friend who confessed to me. I secretly loved her too and I still do. It's frustrating to want something but at the same time be unwilling to pursue it out of fear that it will leave you vulnerable- as if intimacy is some sort of trap!   I know it's not but sometimes fear is irrational.   The advice I have for you is the advice I give myself. The next opportunity you see that someone shows an interest in you (someone who you find physically attractive) just go for it. Seriously. And if you are like me, mimic displays of affection. If he or she displays affection, reciprocate in a way that is similar to the way they did. That way it won't seem that it comes out weird or leaves you vulnerable because they did it first.   It's difficult but for scenarios like this just go off of impulse (but at the same time I encourage you to be careful). And remember, don't have sex just because you are pressured. At the same time, not let your anxiety stop you from pursuing what you want (easier said that done, I know first hand so I encourage you to try the above strategy).   Good luck. ",reddit,1,1

From there, today I can talk to strangers on streets, can easily get my order changed if they made any mistakes, can blend with a group without a fear and many more such things.  How long did it take me to reach here? Well I would say around 2 years but that's not ideal It could be done in just an year I guess  Can I say that I have defeated Social Anxiety completely? No, I haven't but I am on the process and it does not trouble me in functioning normally.  I know how hopeless everything looks because of this disorder.

12127,"I would look up job interview questions that you would likely be asked, read some answers others have used, write your own, and memorize them (or become acquainted with them).  I did this for my first 'real' job back in January '16.  I am not joking when I say that I found, wrote answers to, and memorized 200 questions that I would likely be asked.  For me, if I memorize something well enough it doesn't come across as robotic when I say it because I practice it each time with the correct vocal inflections and tone.  This was the only thing that put my mind more at ease when I walked into that interview room to find four people that would be interviewing me at once.  You are right that you would ""have nothing to lose"" by doing it but we all know that those moments of crippling anxiety are not something any of us look forward to so it makes sense that you are scared.  Your feelings are valid! Anxiety is *not* an easy thing to 'get over' and takes a great deal of time and reworking of your current (anxious) thoughts to continue on the road to recovery.",reddit,0,0
12128,Thank you so much for posting this. I (24F) feel the exact same way and I’m so grateful to you for being brave enough to post it. I don’t know if this is your experience but I’ve always been considered the “nice girl” but being nice to people was really just me being a doormat. When I finally got fed up with letting people walk all over me I felt like I became the boring sensitive friend. I eventually became the sad isolating friend and ended up pushing away a lot of people. What have now realized is that I had/have no personality and I have to figure out who I am from scratch. That’s sort of the phase I am in right now. All I wish for is to be someone who is cool and chill who everyone wants to hang out with.,reddit,1,1

12131,"Damn, I’m sorry to hear that.   I’ve had more than my share of experiences just like this. Idk if this story will help you at all, but if you do read it, I appreciate you taking the time   For example, the first girl I ever worked up the courage to ask on a date, as an adult. It went pretty okay, I was kinda over the moon for her at the time. About a week later, I ask if she wants to hang out, she says she’s doing a bday party for her roommate, but I should come. I’m just like “Man, this is something I HAVE to do.” Work it all out in my head.  So, I show up. This girl isn’t even there at the moment. She spends the first hour or so Of the party out in her car talking to her brother, who’s going through a hard time. I introduce myself to her roommate for a minute. But the place is packed with people, I know nobody. Try to make friendly conversation with some of the guys, but I’m pretty sure they or one of them has a thing for this girl, it’s just obvious they don’t like me or want anything to do with me. We barely interact once she does show up, because she’s all moving around, socializing with these groups of people. I wind up just kinda hanging by the wall, drinking this warm beer I brought because they didn’t even have room in the refrigerator for it lol. With that sinking feeling of panic inside, just retreating into my own mind. Eventually I tell her I had fun and thanks for the invite and dip out.   Actually, I got a message from her about a week later, “Hey! Hope you had a great semester, wanna go out to dinner this week, my treat?” So I’m like “Yea sounds great! How were your exams?” Bout five minutes later, get a response “OMG dude, I’m so sorry! That text was meant for someone else! But we can hang out some time.” Pretty crushing at the time lol  I may feel like a failure on the way home. But as time passes and I look back in retrospect, I’m so glad that I pushed myself and hyped myself up to do it. Because, it’s probably 14 or so years after the fact now. Have had many failures and more importantly, my fair share of successes (with girls or just any kind of socializing) along the way. Never felt sorry for myself, just learned something from it and kept getting back up on the horse. And I know for a fact that, if that same situation hit me today, I’d handle it in a completely different way. Not saying I’d be the life of the party or get the girl, but I’d find a way to have a good time and socialize and just be more confident and fun and less inside my own mind.

Sorry if this will be long but anyways, here it goes.    I’m a 20 y/o Swedish chick who has struggled with being a social outcast for as long as I can remember. I’m extremely introverted and people often get annoyed with me as I can come off as either arrogant (which I’m not, on the contrary I’m really insecure and withdrawn) or just gloomy and difficult. I don’t have a very good sense of humour and feel lost when others laugh and make jokes. Even around close friends I feel lonely and isolated as if I don’t really fit in anywhere.    I have always loved music (mostly heavy stuff) and a little over a year ago I finally decided to get myself a band to jam with. I ended up joining a black metal band as singer and it’s been a lot of fun with parties and gigs. With time we’ve gotten really tight as a group and I’d definetely say those people are my closest friends, but I still can’t shake that feeling of being an outcast. It’s frustrating, because I always feel so out of place. It’s not just my feeling, either, as they (mostly the guitarist who can be a bit of a cunt, especially when he’s drunk) often point out how strange and quiet I am all the time. I sometimes worry that they will let me go just because I’m so introverted, but they all seem pretty happy with my songwriting and stage performance so I’m probably not going anywhere, at least for now. But even if I manage to keep those people around and keep the band going (the music is basically the only thing I live for. I have no other friends, no job, no education or anything) I still feel depressed out of my mind. It doesn’t help that I have severe OCD either (not the kind where I have to check the oven a 1000 times, but the kind where I get nasty instrusive thoughts). Some days I can’t even get out of bed because everything feels so hopeless. My anxieties are killing me, everything feels so bleak and I’m so afraid of ending up completely alone. I can’t enjoy anything anymore and I’m losing control. I’ve become completely obsessed with death and thoughts of suicide. I spend a lot of time just roaming the internet on the hunt for pictures and clips of dead bodies for no good reason at all. I’ve even put myself in potentially dangerous situations just for the lulz.

12144,"Crippling Anxiety around girls. - Im a 14 (male) and i have some really bad anxiety when it comes to talking to girls.  BACKGROUND -------------------------------------------------------------------  I have recently started to notice how anti-social i am with girls, i have never had any kind of problem when talking to my male friends, but i have never really had any female friends since my shcool is basically separated by genders, we go to the same school and everything, but we never got to talk to the girls (at least in school),the only time we acctually get to see each other in school is when we're going home, and the teachers will always tell you to go to your different dispatch areas if you're talking to the girls. Basically, since i have been in this school all the way since Preschool i never got to really know girls, and honestly i didn't care until recently, when we started to go to parties and stuff like that. (I didn't really take much priority over my social life when i was little, i just didn't care. And now i tend to more care on my studies than actually beign social). I remember that whenever i try to talk to girls i just tend to feel akward, out of place, like i dont know what im doing there or what to say. It feels like im just standing there creeply watching everybody talk while i just stand there without saying a word.(Because they're normaly talking about stuff wich i'm not really interested in, so i really cant relate to what they are saying.) So i just slowly back up before i even say a word or just i dont even attempt to talk to them, i know it sounds stupid but i just can't bring myself to talk to them, even if some of my friends are there i just feel out of place, almost as if they're speaking antother language. Beign an introvert i have very few close friends which enjoy the same hobbies as i do (drawing,memes, and other dumb stuff) so i dont normally learn about new stuff, and i tend to just try to ignore some of the ""highschool drama"" (that will often be what they will be talking about). The only one time that i can acctually remember talking to a girl about something and feeling comftable was when i went to an academic tournament, for once i had something to talk about, something to have in common. She gave me her Snapchat, (something which i rarely us, but i appreciated the gesture) i thought i would have a female friend, but as the tournament had ended i just got kind of disconnected, i didnt have anything else to talk about,i tought it would feel odd to talk to her about something else, like she would see me as some kid of creep. I still wanted her to be in touch but once again i just got lost.  Lastly i would like to say that i tend to overthink things, like when i think about gathering up the courage to talk to a girl, ""will she see me as some kind of creep?"", ""Will i look akward?"", "" What does she think of me?"", so many questions that by the time im done thinking either i just decide to not go, or the oportunity has flown out of my grasp.

I know exactly how you feel, that anxiety you feel just thinking about it happening, which then causes it to happen! It's a frustrating cycle that i'm sure seems impossible to get out of, but i'm here to give you hope :)  I used to blush BRIGHT red, in my face, all over my neck and the top of my chest, tops of my arms. The more I focused on it the worse it got until I could find a way to leave the situation. I tried beta blockers for a while and they definitely made it more controllable so i'd look into those before this becomes a bigger deal than it has to be. I find they slow down the time between thinking you're blushing and when you actually turn red, so you can calm yourself down! However I haven't taken them for close to two years now and my blushing has still decreased significantly without them - they aren't a necessity (for me anyway.)  I wish I could give you a miracle cure - when I was in your situation I was searching for one too. Things that have helped me immensely are breathing exercises, meditation, NOT avoiding the situations that cause the blushing - this only makes the situations seem scarier. If you have any questions please ask I'd be happy to answer them.

Sometimes we put way too much weight on ourselves that we can’t carry and it piles up causing anxiety. The code word is habits. Start small: make your bed every morning after you wake up, have healthy breakfasts. Clean your place regularly and do your laundry. Start doing the meal preps in order to get rid of junk food. The reason why you should start from your home is that you come back there every single day after studies/work/etc and when you come back to a dirty, smelly apartment it makes you even more anxious and sad.

I ate by myself those days. I always felt bad because I felt like I was too clingy to her.  Then we graduated from high school and everyone went away to their different universities.

I have severe social anxiety and depression. I take antidepressants, and for the most part they have worked amazingly, my anxiety is definitely less. I just feel so stressed out because we have been socialising all day, and the bedroom door leads to the living room with the sofas literally right outside the door. This means if I want to have some 'down time', I can't because I'm on full display, and if I shut the door then I feel incredibly rude. Either way, it makes me even more anxious as I feel like I need somewhere I can unwind when things get too much.   The thing is, I've spend 23 years living with my narcissistic mother and a brother with severe mental illness who both made my life a living hell. Once they decided I was no longer a fun target, they took to completely ignoring my existence instead. The past couple of years have been incredibly lonely, and in that time the ideas I have that no one likes me or wants to be around me have only been reinforced.

I got a horrible stomach ache that just wouldn't go away, and I had to go home. But the frustrating thing was that within half an hour of getting back home it disappeared. Maybe I was nervous because at the last sleepover I felt completely out of place and isolated while having to share my personal space with other people.  I didn't get these stomach aches much for the next few years and couldn't connect them to anything particular.  Fast forward to 19/20, and some weird shit is happening.  On the first day of my new job in the summer. Over a period of an hour I got increasingly worsening cramps and nausea to the point where I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and leave my shift. I got even more nauseous in the care and when I got back home I vomited. My stomach ache stuck for the night. I didn't think much of it and thought it was food poisoning from a chicken pie I ate for breakfast that had been left out all night (in summer temperatures).  But then it happened again 2 weeks later on my job. It was an extremely stressful and fast-paced day. We were the busiest we'd ever been and I just wasn't coping. I was making too many mistakes and the managers were yelling at me. Again over an hour I developed bad cramping and nausea, and at the same time I excused myself and quit my job (the manager was glad). In the car I got even more nauseas. And I did not make it home. I vomited on the sidewalk. But about an hour after I came home everything levelled off and I felt fine.  Important to note that during that summer I was on birth control that was making me severely fatigued. So I stopped it and tried another one.  So for a couple of months I've been involved in a lot of projects and been meeting a lot of people. This is after being isolated for a whole year with my childhood friends slowly dropping over the years or disbanding due to fights. This really messed with my self-esteem where I thought I was just repulsive to people. So least to say I was pretty nervous every time I tried to talk to people.  I'm getting anxiety symptoms with some friends but not others. It's those friends that my strict family would disapprove of. I really try to not be nervous. I really make an effort to look forward to the occasion. In my mind I'm thinking: ""I am ready to party, I am ready to have fun. I am having fun.""   But I can't help it that every single time I hang out with certain people, I shake the whole time. And then at some point, the stomach ache starts. It might decrease or increase randomly, it might get so bad to the point where I'm very uncomfortable. Nausea may start. I felt the threat of vomit when we took a taxi home one time. And it always disappears when I get back home.  And then, this is when shit's becoming too much.  I got it at my grandparents. My freakin' grandparents. I visit them only occasionally. I don't have a good relationship with them at all, it took a nosedive over the past 3 years, plus they're getting more fragile by the month. I had noticed some visits ago how it's odd that I'm getting tremors. But this time I got nauseas and had to leave. As usual, it passed in about an hour after coming back home.  It has to be anxiety. I don't think it's the birth control.  I don't know what to do about it. In these situations my mind tells me I'm calm but my body says otherwise.   I've been going to therapy on and off for the past 4 years. Many of the professionals weren't really good, but I've stuck with the same therapist for more than a year now. So I am getting therapy.   I tried an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic, and then in combination, for 6 months in total. And they did nothing. And I really don't want to go on medication because of their side-effects. I know 3 people who took anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication and it completely wrecked them.",reddit,1,1

I can't even get myself to look for a new job because the interview process scares the shit out of me. I got the job I have now because my brother works there and they needed people so I didn't have to go through the process. Anyways, I work in fast food and its exhausting. Some regulars come often and this woman was one. She offered me an ""interview"" at her place where she's the store manager. It's another fast food place but it's a way less fast pace. So I said yes. I go in and I tell her I'm sorry that I didn't have my resume with me because I don't have a printer at home. Which is true. And the interview was very last minute. Anyways, she tells me not to worry, that she's seen me in the job I have now and she likes how I work. She takes me in the back to watch people cook and tell me that's what I'd be doing. She even had me take pictures of the dos and don'ts on the wall. So, in the end, she asks me about my schedule for the other job because I would like to do both. I give it to her. She asks if I can take Tuesdays off my other job because that's when shes short. I said I would talk to my other job. She then asks me for my contact info and I give her my phone and email. She tells me she will call me(well she used the word text) one of the days the following week and when she does she'll tell me a day to come in and bring her my food handlers certificate and come dressed. I say okay and we say our goodbyes. Then a week pasts and nothing. I've already talked to my other job to get Tuesday off. I've told everybody about this new job now so my coworker told me that when she drove by the place the window was broken. So I guess they got broken into? I don't know. It's been almost been three weeks and I haven't heard a thing. She knows where I work and that's the place she asked me for the interview. I figure if she tried to get a hold of me and couldn't she could go there? But I haven't seen her. So I'm going there tomorrow to get an answer and I'm freaking out. I want to throw up. **What do I say when I go in?** ""So do I still get the job?"" My father is pushing me to go in too so I feel like I have to. This is my first time so please go easy on me.

She sorta got an internet addiction, I guess, and became somewhat neglectful. She didn't know I even had social anxiety disorder until recently, like maybe three weeks ago.  My father was a druggie and an alcoholic. He was a shitty father. Still is, but he's changed a lot. He's become a religious nut, like he literally believes I am possessed by demons and shit because I have a bloody Harry Potter book in my room. He won't accept that I have mental illnesses. He'd rather accept that I have demons inside of me, haha. I'm apart of the LGBTQ+ community and if he were to find out, fuck, I'd be disowned at best and physically harmed at worst. He's violent and volatile and very, very crazy.  My relationship with my siblings isn't the best. My older brother was violent as a kid and even while he was in his late teens. (He moved at around 20.) Choking me was like a game to him, haha. So you kinda get an idea. Now that he's moved we rarely see each other unless during family get-togethers. I have a twin sister and she's a lot like my brother. She used to be pretty violent but now we have our own rooms, so we can get away from each other as needed. She found out about me having suicidal ideation and she wasn't supportive at all. She told me to cut and kill myself to my face and said she'd like to watch me die.

Being around new people at parties and other gatherings has made me realize how bad I am at socializing. Certain insecurities really get to me when I am around people I do not know well. For example, I am insecure about how young I look (a lot of people say I look 16-18), and I feel like I am taken less seriously and that I am unattractive because of it :/. I am also currently avoiding going downstairs because my roommates are partying, and although part of me wants to hang out with them, I am anxious and tired of being around people.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't really want to get a diagnosis and start taking medication because part of me doubts that I have social anxiety.

Person B: wow, I would *never* go telling my friends about when I’ve rejected someone. I would just feel like such a horrible person.

Person A: no, it wasn’t gossiping, it was just stating.   Person B: sureeeeee it was.        *Example 2:*  Person A: when I was 13 I used to make those cringey indirect on statuses on Facebook. I’m so embarrassed by it now.   Person B: I *never* did that. It’s such a weird thing that only drama-lovers do.   Person A: yeah, well, I was only 13 haha.

Most of them like to party and I'm not much of a partier.    I can't stand the taste of alcohol, and as a man that goes to a very conservative university, being a ""bitch"" when it comes to alcohol can be very frustrating. I'm often invited to parties a lot and every time I go out I'm usually standing in the corner or just moving from one person to the next trying to mingle. I'm bad at it, it's uncomfortable for me, and overall I don't find enjoyment or it doesn't seem worth it to me.  I usually try to find ways to leave parties early before things get too turned up or when anything besides alcohol turn up at the party.   I was thinking I need different friends, ones that do other things on the weekends rather than go to house parties. But that can be hard for me, as I'm already a junior in school and making friends is tough as it is. I'm involved in a bunch of things on campus both academically and personal interest. So I'm busy throughout the week but when it comes to the weekend I'm usually free and have open time.   I've tried religious groups to meet new people too, but due to lack of interest I couldn't keep myself to attend every week.

12197,"I'm wasting my life - I'm a 15 year old girl and I hardly do anything fun. I never even had a boyfriend, while most of my friends already had sex. I've never been to a concert and I'm hardly invited to partys. When I am, I just sit in some corner, because I'm too insecure to dance or drink too much. It all just hit me now, because my extroverted friend, who has adopted me, always makes fun of me and calls me weird, because I act different around her than around others and lately she kind of avoids me. When we meet new people, she always tells them I don't talk or that I'm shy right away which makes it really hard for me to even try. I'm pissed at her, but there is nothing I can do because at school, I would be all alone withoit her and I'm not good at confronting people. I do have other friends, but only because of her and a few months ago I also lost a really good friend who didn't go to my school because I wasn't feeling good and didn't text talk to her anymore.

12198,"I'm SICK and TIRED of being socially awkward, so I'm going to change. - Hey everyone,  Like most of you here, I'm socially inept to the point where I've gone through life with very few friends. Growing up I moved a lot, so any connections I made with others were short lived. I'm convinced having to start over so many times throughout my life coupled with being terrified of entering new schools every few years took a hand in developing the socially awkward guy I currently am.   Being 21 years old in university, I accepted my fate of being a ""foreveralone"" as I was never good in conversation and always made terrible first impressions. I was in a mindset that being alone wasn't so bad, and thus I was relatively happy with cruising through life alone. Then suddenly out of the blue, this GORGEOUS girl from one of my classes walked up to me and asked if I understood a problem from our homework. Long story short we ended up talking a bit more and the craziest thing was happening--I was actually getting along with someone, and fairly well at that! Never in MY LIFE have I EVER had conversations with any girl to this extent! We continued to talk and hangout for the next few weeks.  Unfortunately, this chemistry I thought we had was also short-lived. I began to get nervous seeing her, I began to over-analyze what I had said and what I would say the next time I would talk to her, and I even developed a crush on her! This combination ruined everything. What I thought was me finally breaking out of my shell was only temporary. I became awkward again and now our friendship is hanging by a thread.   I am so SICK of having social anxiety. Every single night I'm up thinking about her, this one girl who's turned my entire perspective on life upside down. I now realize that I don't like being alone and never have! Telling myself being alone is fine was just a coping mechanism. I want more out of life, and I REFUSE to let this crippling fear of talking to others get the better of me!   I won't let myself get depressed about being bad at talking to others, I won't accept that I'm destined to be alone for the rest of my life, and I won't give up on fixing my relationship with this girl who's made me the happiest I've been in years.   The fall semester is almost over and I have a few classes with my first friend in who knows how long next semester. As a scrawny guy with average grades, I know that my low confidence is one of the major obstacles to beating social anxiety, so I'm going to start by going to the gym as soon as finals are over. I'm going to get piano lessons as I've always wanted to learn an instrument, I'm going to start reading books again, and I'm never going to turn down an offer or opportunity to socialize as I used to avoid them like the plague (unless school/work gets in the way).   I know I'll never be with this girl, the first girl in my life who I've genuinely fallen for, but that doesn't mean there aren't others who might be a good match for me. I want to have a family and grow old with someone while being surrounded by good, true friends, and damnit I'm going to!  Sorry for the wall.  I just wanted to unload what's on my mind somewhere.   TL;DR: My experiences through life shaped me into the awkward guy I am today. As a 21-year-old in university, I accepted my fate of being a ""foreveralone"" and tried to move on. Suddenly, a beautiful girl from one of my classes approached me asking for homework help, and a friendship developed but was then almost crushed by my anxiety. I'm done with having social anxiety and am determined to beat it. This girl helped me realize that I truly do want to be surrounded by friends and have meaningful relationships, and I won't let my awkwardness prevent this from happening. I'm going to fix my relationship with the first girl I've genuinely fallen for in my life and beat social anxiety!  EDIT: Wording  ",reddit,1,1
12199,"Stop trying to fit in with people who don't get you - I (24f) learned a hard lesson over the years - trying desperately to fit in only perpetuates your social anxiety. You want so badly to belong, to have people like you,  that you will just hang out with anyone in the hopes that one day someone might accept you. But I say - no, you need to be intentional with who you are connecting with. If it becomes clear you're not on the same wavelength, move along and wish them well. Stop hanging on to people who are not interested in you, don't like you or, worst of all, respect you. In other words, have some self-respect. Find your people!   I found I was torturing myself by forcing myself to be in situations I didn't actually want to be in, pretending to be interested in people I didn't even like, because I was so insecure and desperate to be accepted. I was trying to ""prove"" myself to other people. Trying to be who they wanted me to be. In doing so, I ignored my own values, dismissed my own feelings of discomfort and tried to change myself.   Now, I can talk to anyone without putting the same pressure on myself to belong. I feel lighter. Life became easier! Do I still have moments of insecurity? Yes. Do certain situations trigger anxiety in me from the past? Yes. But am I bothered on a day to day basis what other people think of me? No, not really.

12200,"There's more to life than sex. What worries me a lot about these posts from men is that they tend to focus on the physical side of sex and having a partner. ""I've never fucked anyone"" is essentially what you're saying. But there's so much more to being with someone than that. Sex is just sex. ""Making love"" with someone is much, much better than ""any hole is a goal"".  Honestly I'd much rather be with a man who doesn't watch porn and doesn't have experience. Porn has destroyed good sex and the importance of relationships. Men who watch porn are often rubbish in bed and can't perform for very long at all.  Let me tell you, I'm a woman but when I popped my cherry at 18, I regretted it. The sex was rubbish and the guy dumped me shortly after. I wish more than anything that my current boyfriend had been my first. Find someone to love, and who loves you back. ""How can I do that? I've got social anxiety!""

12201,"Am I wasting my youth? - I spent most of my childhood fluctuating between having zero friends, and having one or two. Right now it's none. I'll talk to people at school. There are people I'm friendly with and on good terms with. But I have no real friends. I have no real life friends who I ever talk to via text or any social media, or meet up with on our own time. I never check my phone and see messages from friends. There was I point where I had one friend who I might text. But now it's no one. I don't even expect it. Every day I'm 100% confident that no one has tried to contact me.  &amp;#x200B;  It seems like everyone has a group of friends you could call \*the boys\* or \*the guys\* or \*the gang\*. They'll get into wacky antics and have banter and see each other on a regular basis. That would be incredible. I have nothing like that. I watched a film called \*I Vitelloni\* earlier, and it got me thinking about that. The whole point was that the characters were a bunch of deadbeat man-children. But they were THE GUYS. I'm so jealous of that. I wish I at least had the \*ability\* to be immature and have fun with a bunch of jackass friends. My life is seriously lacking in banter.  &amp;#x200B;  I feel like I'm wasting my youth. I'm a senior in high school now. People say these are the best years of the life, and they say you absolutely \*must\* have as much fun as possible. You \*have\* to get laid in high school and if you don't, it's only downhill from there. You've basically wasted the high point of your life. Of course, I know this is complete and utter bullshit. Those are morons who peeked in their teens. But I'm terrified of the idea that there's some grain of truth in it. There will never be an opportunity for an experience quite like high school ever again, and I sure as hell didn't get to really experience it.  &amp;#x200B;  Senior year is too late. Everyone already knows me as the quiet guy, and they've already found their friend groups. They won't talk to me. They're reserved because they don't want to leave the little cliques they've stuck with four the past several years.  They pretty much already know me, and have formed their opinions on me. If they ever wanted to be friends with me, they would have done it by now. That opportunity is over. I can simply never make friends with these people. The only chances I have are new people. Strangers. But they're so rare. I'll still end up not having many people to talk to. I've wasted all these years that I'll never get back.  &amp;#x200B;  I know how ridiculous I sound. Going on about wasting my youth when I'm still young. Who ever heard of a mid-life crisis at 17? People tell me I still have time. But I don't' buy that. When I was a freshman, I was sure I would be having fun and getting around by sophomore year, then it was junior year, and now I have fewer years ahead and even less hope for them. I know I can't just immediately turn things around. By the time I do, my youth will be over. Realistically I have no chance. Changing my whole lifestyle won't happen immediately and if I ever do, I'll barely have any youth left. Besides,  I'll never get the years I definitely have wasted back.  &amp;#x200B;  People talk about how hard it is to have close friends as an adult.

She's been your friend for 15+ years, and even though you've had a bit of distance between you and your friend, 8 months will not erase 15+ years of friendship. Trust me, she will not be annoyed or upset by you texting her and you won't overwhelm her with your problems. As for the fear of sending that first message, maybe send it just before you sleep, so that you won't feel super anxious about when your friend will respond. I recommend sticking your phone far away from your bed and turning on Do Not Disturb on it, so you don't feel tempted to check it every time that it buzzes. I'd recommend scheduled sending, but I believe the app that does this requires a paid subscription, but if you feel more comfortable with a scheduled send, then go for it. Scheduling important emails to be sent out while I'm asleep has been super helpful for my anxiety (a strategy that I used this for would be my LORs this week), so if you feel like sending a scheduled text helps and you are willing to pay a small fee, then go for it.  As for the anxiety and fear that you feel both before and after, just know this: it's alright if your friend doesn't respond immediately. Maybe they are busy or have something on the side, but know this: there is a reason you guys have been friends for 15+ years and she will respond to you, so have faith in yourself. I hope that this first text between you and your friend goes well and you guys will be able to rebuild and reconnect, and I sincerely hope that you have a great weekend!",reddit,0,0

12232,"Been doing some self reflection - I’ve (20m) always suffered from social anxiety but recently I’ve been trying to take the necessary steps to get over it (I’m in the beginning stages).  I started keeping a journal, I listen to podcasts, do self affirmations, and I’m more active in group chats etc.. I’m really proud of the progress I’m making but I feel like I owe most of my progress to being in an intimate relationship for the first time outside of those childish middle school flings. My girlfriend has really helped build up my self confidence and being around her very outspoken family forces me to be more social.  I don’t have any SERIOUS concerns about my relationship because I’m happy but I’m curious as to if other introverts think we latch on to the first relationship that comes our way because we feel like it’s the best we can do. I’m happy in my current relationship and I love her but some part of me on the inside wonders if I’m only attached to her because I’m afraid of being alone again. It’s hard enough making friends with how shy I am so talking to girls was even 1000x harder. So it makes me wonder if it’s possible that Ive convinced myself that I’m happy because she’s the only person that I’ve ever been able to form a bond with and I don’t want to lose it. Ultimately, I don’t plan on ever ending this relationship because there’s no reason to... but everything I stated before is something I ponder a lot. Any thoughts?

I had no idea that this sweet, shy, funny, adorably awkward redhead who I'd been having burping contests and building forts with for years felt the same way about me. So I punched him in the arm. And then said yes. We didn't end up kissing for another year after that, and it was just as awkward.

12236,"Hi everyone! New member here! :) - Long read :(   I'm an Asian 23F soon to be 24. A little back story, I've always been the shy, quiet, introverted, normal girl but that all changed junior year of high school after getting bullied for being the shy, quiet and introverted girl LOL. A group of kids just got a kick out of how I would react when being put on the spot and they realized if they stared at me long enough throughout class I would become flustered. I blushed easily so what was my solution to that? A LOT OF MAKE UP. I looked like an actual clown. I cringe about it to this day but in my 16 year old head I thought I would rather get made fun of for how much foundation I had than people seeing me turn into a tomato.   So that's how my social anxiety happened. I didn't like attention, I didn't like eye contact, I didn't like interacting with anyone for fear of them judging me and witnessing an embarrassing sight. This lead me to overthink EVERYTHING. I resorted to safety behaviors which meant staying home most of the time but it got bit better when I was 19 years old. My aunt had this store that she needed help running and because she spoke very limited English she pulled my ass in to help. I thought it was a one week thing but I ended up staying there for 4 years. The first year was brutal but as the years went by these interactions came a lot easier. During this time I was able to get my first job as a barista/cashier and get my drivers license. Two things I never thought I would be able to do. I worked at a boba shop and it wasn't busy so it was easier to manage and the place was close by so driving there was also okay (I also have driving anxiety...). A year went by and I decided to quit and add to my resume after my cousin referred me to work as a front desk receptionist at an optometrist office. That was probably the worst decision of my life. The work environment was extremely toxic. The people that ran the office micromanaged everything, evaluated you on everything. Spoke condescendingly to you and made you feel incompetent...it was hell. I wanted to quite but for my cousin's sake, I didn't want to make him look bad. I was there for about 5 months when the pandemic happened. It was a blessing in disguise for me because it meant a break from all that. I was preparing myself to go back in after a few weeks but it spanned 5 months. I knew they would call me in eventually but thought of going back scared the absolute crap out of me. I eventually got the call and after two weeks of being there I put in my two weeks notice because just as I expected, I couldn't handle it. Before, I was able to put up a front and tell my self to stop being a little bitch and to do what I was told to do and leave. Not the best coping mechanism but it's what got me through. Now, I was now holding back tears in the break room and crying while driving home after every shift. I quit and I focused on school which was still all held online at the time. I couldn't even do an online presentation for one my classes because of how bad my anxiety got. It didn't even require me to turn on the camera, just audio and I couldn't do it. The pandemic that I thought was a blessing in disguise turned out to be the opposite. I feel like from 19-22 I made progress and now I'm back at where I started but this time older and more expectations and pressure from family and society now that I graduated. I also forgot to mention that I dropped two toxic friends along the way. I only have one friend now but we have our issues too. She's understanding and I share a lot with her but...I don't get that closeness like I did with the other two friends. It's weird. I feel alone and I want to make more friends but making friends as an adult is rough and it's even harder when you don't go out and think everyone hates you lol.   I actually went to see a psychiatrist yesterday because it was getting a bit much for me. A lot of ruminating thoughts and a lot of questions like, ""How the hell am I expected to live a decent life if I can't do simple things like x, y, and z?"" Fear turned into anger and I really don't want to keep living like this anymore. I graduated and I need to get on with life. I need to either find a job or go back to school to pursue higher education. I haven't decided on either yet but the main thing holding me back is my social anxiety. My psychiatrist told me that exposure therapy is what I need to do. I need to embrace that rush I get and become conditioned to get use to doing things like driving, talking to people, doing things by myself, etc. I was also prescribed Lexapro, and propranolol. I haven't picked them up yet but he said that these are here to hopefully help kickstart my journey but everything else is willpower and motivation. I can't say I have any of that right now but sharing all of this does help a bit..  If you got through all that, thank you. If not, I understand because this is extremely long lol.

12243,"25F never had a job - I don’t know if I can ever get out of this rut. I’m 25, graduated last year during the pandemic. I’ve never had the need for jobs growing up because my family was financially stable at the time and my mom wanted to me focus on my studies in my adolescence. I pursued higher education from ages 20 to 24 and I knew I should have used the opportunities offered during my course of study to take up internships for some work experience but my social anxiety had always stopped me from doing so. Anyway, I knew that after I graduated, I wanted to take a few months off because I studied my ass off for those 4 years to land a spot on the dean’s list and win a research book prize for my thesis at the time of my graduation. Well, those short months turned into a year and I’m still without a job. I’ve never been someone who knew what they wanted to do in life nor do I have any skills that make me exceptional. I’m just.... a blank slate. Earlier this year, I went back to school for a few free classes offered to my cohort of “covid” graduates in the hopes of testing the waters in a field I thought I would be interested it.

She just finished her last round of chemotherapy. I’m not sure about the prognosis but I want to be able to get a job and make her proud and be able to support her financially too.

I have a big jaw and so where a person's jaw normally is, mine is just out farther forward. It makes me feel like a little kid because if I'm looking down then it gets all chubby and sticks out farther. To add to that, it's not easy for me to keep my mouth shut for long. Like physically. I'm 17 years old and have sideburns I shouldn't have to worry about looking like a kid.  For a while I thought I just needed to get used to it but it's bad to the point where literally anyone sitting next to me facing the same direction as me fills me with unease and I can't stop thinking about it. I have to face them straight forward. Even just watching a movie where someone is facing another person's side makes me so anxious. I want to rip my jaw out, break off a quarter inch, and shove it back where it's supposed to be.   That and I have 2 moles on my face that I wish would go away forever and die.   And my open bite. Since my jaw kept growing after I got my braces off, it pretty much nullified me ever having them so now I can close my jaw completely and literally none of my front teeth will come close to meeting.

12250,"M/23. My life was set up for social failure. I don't know what to do. - Context: Growing up, because of family issues I switched schools and homes consistently until highschool. I did not have any friends and all I had were videogames, anime and manga. Period. No family. No close friends. Just those 3 things and an emotionally abusive dad. When I went to college I didn't have time to play games so I dedicated myself to smash as I was able to make friends that way. Same thing with anime. I stopped watching for the most part for because of school and stuck to mainly manga. As college passed and I played through the last of the game series I was still of fan, KH and Persona, I lost the urge for gaming almost entirely. I didn't really have a driver to play games anymore, at least not if someone didn't tell me what to play as I don't know games or publishers. With anime, that fizzled entirely. The last show I binged was HxH and when I was done I felt as though I wasted a solid 3 days. So the remnants of past only leave me with manga. I still care for manga. I still have opinions but that's all I have. . . . For comparison, and I know I shouldn't be comparing myself to others but I have friends who are into Magic, DnD, Fanfic writing, Queer Culture, Knitting, Art, Videogames, and so on. . . but I don't feel like I have anything. . . You can imagine how hard it is to try to converse with others when you literally have nothing to talk about. LITERALLY. So being social. Having friends. Talking to others. Caring authentically. It's hard. I unintentionally ghost everyone who interacts with me because I truly have nothing to say.  After reading posts on Reddit I started basic socialization and anti-anxiety/depression training by going to the gym, dressing better, meditating, journaling and learning very basic conversation etiquette as long as I'm not the focus of the conversation. . . . which. . .makes me not want to talk to people even more because being a wall and only asking questions to keep the conversation going kinda sucks. . . a lot.  And a side note: A thought I conceived is that most adults who are NOT introverted or obsessed/are mega enthusiasts are extroverts because they've socialized enough in their youth to enjoy the presence of others. Sooo even though I dropped my introverted hobbies and learned to socialize, I feel as though psychologically acclimated to deriving pleasure around others. I kinda just feel empty.  So TL;DR. My youth was basically living in an echo-chamber of games and weeb shit. I've grown to not care for games and anime much so I have literally nothing else to define me. I yearn to simply be able to be around others and genuinely enjoy it . . . . but I can't/it's really fucking hard to make friends if I have nothing to define me/talk about.

12255,"First of all, I'm really impressed by how aware and reflective you are about your own feelings and behaviors, as well as how you're trying to continually work on yourself. I've struggled with depression all my life and social anxiety for about 15 years, and it's often felt like I can't do anything to change it -- I mean, often I can't when episodes are at their peak. However, I've learned various triggers and ways of controlling things that do influence my depression and anxieties. And a lot takes practice and patience. I think you clearly are practicing and seem to have a lot of patience.  What I would be worried about is thinking of it in terms of molding yourself to become a ""better"", ""less awkward"", ""normal"" person, as opposed to keeping your ""creepy shell"" on. While it can be good to try to learn to adjust your behaviors and how you express yourself in order to come across as more socially adept and not as awkward, stressing this too heavily might lead to self-judgment about things you don't need to judge yourself for, like (1) things you do that are awkward in themselves and not because of you or (2) things that aren't awkward for other people but that you feel are awkward.  As an example of (1), often times co-workers (who are not independently great friends) will feel pressure to make small talk when they first come into the office. This is often awkward for a lot of people. I, for one, find small talk really awkward, and in these contexts I've tended to be excessively focused on my own expressions of my feeling awkwardness -- which in turn leads me to behave outwardly even more awkwardly. I have tried in the past to make myself more sociable and take control of the conversation, and found some success at times; but honestly, I find myself less capable of doing this when my depression and anxieties are significantly high. Something I found that works better for me is to learn to be comfortable with this kind of awkwardness. It takes a lot of patience, but I've been feeling less anxiety in these situations.   That office small talk example could work as an example of (2) as well, because I've become friends with some people who I work with who eventually tell me that I wasn't awkward at all -- even though I distinctly remember it *feeling awkward and behaving obviously awkward*. A lot of the things you mention in your first list seem to be things that are just inherently, or very often, awkward for all parties involved. Flirting with someone is awkward for most, I'm pretty sure (it is for me!); getting rejected is as well (fuck me ded); being in a conversation where someone leaves you on read is awkward (Dear God, it's me...); etc. I think it's okay to feel awkward in these situations. If it's important to you to flirt with your crush, not let rejection get you down, etc., I think one big part of it will be learning to be more comfortable in these awkward situations. I like your example of flirting and then feeling like you made the conversation uncomfortable and then opening up about that. I think the most neutral response would be not to mention the feeling that the convo is now uncomfortable, but it seems that it's an important feeling you have atm. It's good that you notice it, but also it doesn't seem to bad to even express that to someone or to add the disclaimer that you tend to overthink these things. That kind of ""word vomit"" is genuine and honest and, imo, not awkward. Those who say it's awkward probably have in mind a person who is not Gaston and not overly confident about everything.   TL;DR: The point I'm taking way too long to make is that trying to inhibit your dispositions to express your anxieties or feeling of awkwardness is sometimes unnecessary (because the awkwardness is due to the situation) and potentially quite unhealthy (because you may end up feeling terrible for not successfully inhibiting all of those dispositions). Moreover, although you can definitely find success at modualting the way you express your feelings and thoughts in general, I'm a firm believer in the idea that mental states like depression and anxiety are very robust and will find a way to express themselves. So just inhibiting them can potentially create a bunch of pain. It all depends on the full story of YOU, but it's something you should keep in mind. So, sure, try and learn to feel *okay* when someone leaves you on read -- that may help you in similar situations in the future (like emotional weigh lifting!) -- but also be sure to attend to your feelings and how bad it would feel to keep them in vs. how good it would feel to let them out organically.",reddit,0,0

But I made sure to push the skills I learned from working there. Even if it wasn't impressive, I tried to make it seem impressive and it worked. I got the job! I had to go through two interviews talking about that job and other school stuff for the questions about my skills and experience. If anybody's looking for a job and worried about not having much experience, just push the skills that you do have. Whether it be from classes, a job, volunteer work or just being around people in general. Employers want to know that you can deal with people. At least that's what I've gathered.

I was spontaneous, funny, and even outgoing for a while. But more than anything i felt authentic and i loved myself a lot.  Since the breakup I'm worse than I've ever been. I feel like I'm in danger everywhere i go and everyone is judging me, and even if i go out with people I've known for years, I'm too terrified to talk and i just sit there like a doll. I just smile and wave and if i do talk i rehearse what i wanna say countless times in my head and most of the time i just end up giving up and staying quiet. When I'm leaving home to meet my friends i always have bad anxiety attacks and i often have to hide in the bathroom for a while when i get to the meeting spot.  Because of all this rehearsing i do in my mind i think i might come off as someone who isn't authentic and that worries me.

12263,"I basically live at my boyfriend's house but barely interact with his room mates... I feel guilty about it. - So, I'll start off this post by saying that I had a year of being severely agoraphobic (in 2016) and pretty instantaneously got into a tinder relationship a few months after starting to interact with people again. I was doing fine for a while in terms of social interaction but of course it never felt completely comfortable for me again.  Anyways, after a while I started developing body dysmorphia again (I've struggled with it ever since my mother was diagnosed with cancer and then passed away, sorry for the TMI) and basically feel as if everybody is judging how I look and thinking negatively about me as a person. This has caused a great complex in my relationship with my boyfriend and myself due to the fact I basically stay inside his room and minimally interact with his room mates when they are home. I'm pretty cordial when I see them, but I really can't stand being around people for too long or I get horrendously nervous and self aware. Anyways, I feel hella guilty for being this way and I wonder why this man I'm with is choosing to be with this socially awkward chick who isn't ""normal"" enough to literally just talk to people. I pretty much spend all my time with him and here, and I feel super scared and lonely when were not together and we could be (like when he's not working). I realize that co-dependence in general is unhealthy but neither of us are doing anything about it- I like being around him... even though I'm depressed as f*** and I don't really know what I'm living for. Regardless, my social anxiety sucks and I want to know how to deal with this or at least rant about it. How do I get over this fear of needing to be approved of/thinking the world is harshly critical?  Anyways I feel people think I'm weird looking/look like a tranny but I can't tell if it's in my head. I'm a 22 year old female and I just am hella uncomfortable with my appearance- like I don't see many girls who look like me, and that makes me feel really nervous and sad.

I isolate myself in their house, and I don't know how to get over this feeling of being hella weird and detached.  ",reddit,1,1

Now I have issues talking to people and am struggling to even get a job because of it. Its sucks because that's the thing that would really fix my problems now and I wasn't like this before. Step one for me? Get a job. Sounds simple but a lot goes with it. It doesn't have to but it does. The phone call? I cant even make one. I feel so dumb for not being able to do that. That's the step after applying. A simple thing would make conditions better for me and probably ease some anxiety but anxiety is the problem in the first place. I feel so dumb and disappointed in myself for getting this way and it hit me like a bus. I never thought I'd have a problem with something that can be hard but can get done. I feel this post a lot.

I don't know why, but I felt left out when I came back.  That was the idea that has been in mind mind since then. Today it seems like that idea grew even more. I feel like we do not have meaningful conversarions any more. They just want to party, joke and drink. And when they don't do that, they say stories about those situations.  Now, I used to enjoy this thing until last year.

12271,"Ok good.  It makes sense that you ""feel"" bad when they come up.  Since they are from you POV, it means that you are associated into them.  This means that your feelings are turned ""on"".  This also means, that the way you have stored these in your memory...each time you bring them up it is just like they are happening right now...so you get to feel bad over and over again.  A great trick to take the edge of is to dissociate these memories.  Do this by:  1.  think of the scene that bothers you the most 2.  Now take all the color out of the scene in the ipad 3.  Use your powerful imagination to see that scene on an ipad that you are holding in your hands.   4.  Then step out of yourself and move about 20 feet back. 5.  See yourself 20 feet in front of you holding an ipad watching the scene 6.  If you still have any feelings about this scene pretend that there is a wall of plexyglass (wall to wall, ceiling to floor) between you and the version of you that is watching the black and white scene far away on the ipad.  Now how much emotion do you have of that particular scene?  We are messing with your submodalities.  We are changing the way that the memory is stored in you brain.    It should feel less real and very fake to you right now.  Repeat this until you no longer feel anything for it.",reddit,0,0

There’s a quote that says, “When a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.” I like to think of it when I feel like I’m not able to grow, even though I want to. Sometimes “the environment” is the system we are born into, which we can’t immediately change, but it helps me reaffirm that maybe if our society honored how unique we all are, how uniquely we operate… we could all fulfill our potential. The way I see it, there’s nothing wrong with you at all. You’re unique in your own way. I believe that people like us are needed in this world, it’s just some aspects of this complex system are not built for us. You’re not ungrateful, or horrible, I promise you; the voice in your head telling you that is lying. Even if you dropped out, in my eyes, the fact that you even enrolled and showed up is a feat in itself. I’m really proud of you because I know how hard it is.

There's this girl there that makes me lose composure every time I work with her, like damn, every time she walks by my pulse feels like it goes through the roof. I've been bottled up with these feelings for a few years now, but the thought of asking her out is absurd to me.   She's funny, adorable and whenever I make her smile or laugh at some stupid joke I tell her my day is pretty much made, and the way she laughs kills me.

Now here's the problem though, even though I wish I could make things happen, I don't want pretty much the one little light in my day/week snuffed out because I made her uncomfortable by approaching her like that, which would, in turn, probably lead to her avoiding me.

The first time she asked me what time I'm off work, my brain went into overdrive. Then I realized she would sometimes ask other people that. I'm not quite sure why, maybe she just wanted to strike up small talk or something, so I was just like ""okay, whatever, move on"".

There are different reasons behind that, partly that I have this fear that my problems aren't ""bad enough"" and people and professionals will judge and ridicule me in different ways and think I'm just making things up. I hope it's still okay that I post here, but if not I'll delete my post. I'll be explaining some of my ""problems"" at first but if it's too long to read I guess you can skip to the bold text further down.   &amp;#x200B;  *  I often ""freeze"" in social situations (mostly with strangers but occasionally with people I know too) to the point where I can barely talk. People often think I'm rude or hate them when they meet me.  *  I focus so much on how I'm perceived and what others think of me. It can be everything from how much eye contact I should be giving someone to what I'm wearing or how I'm performing a task.  * I struggled on my previous job because of this. I worked as a substitute teacher at different daycare centers in my area and got called in when a teacher was sick or so. Every time there was another adult in the same room as me, I could barely talk to the kids. Sometimes the kids were fighting and  screaming, but I was froze and couldn't do anything about it, so another adult had to handle it. This made me feel so embarrassed and worthless.. Whenever I was alone with the kids though, I could do the job pretty well. It was just that I was so afraid that the other adults looked at me and saw all the things I was doing wrong and thought I was doing my job poorly. I called  in sick a few times because I spent the whole night or morning before work crying uncontrollably because I knew what was waiting for me at work.   **Now I'm gonna proceed to the thing that I wanted to ask about**. I'm 19 years old and currently trying to figure out what to study at university. I still feel very lost, but my brain keeps coming back to a few career paths that I find interesting. There's only one problem: All of them are pretty social professions that would require constant social contact. A few examples of them are: ,Nurse, doctor, psychologist, dentist and teacher.   Whenever I read about different career paths, I always come back to these kind of jobs. I guess that means I'm interested in them, but I'm just so scared of things ending badly. What if I study for 4 years and start working just to realize that I get paralyzed with anxiety most days and can't do my job properly? I'm really scared. Is it possible to get over social anxiety (if that's what I have) or should I accept that these careers aren't suitable for me? :(",reddit,1,1

12295,"I told my crush how I feel.. Kind of - I'm a 18 year old bi male who has a friend who I've pretty recently developed feelings for.  We met last year in my art class. For many months it was just us talking about things like video games, anime, TV shows, stuff like that.  After summer vacation, I'm assigned to a first hour class with him. It's largely stayed the same but something was different. Something that was so minuscule I don't even know what changed. Over the weeks, we slowly started talking more comfortably to each other and after a couple weeks I got his Twitter (big step for me, I can barely talk to people) and for a good week we simply talked about things we would normally talk about over DMs after school.  It's important to note at this point I started noticing I had butterflies developing. So, I very very gently started making moves. He's an extrovert and I'm introvert so I don't think the moves were obvious though. However, I'm not sure because he does seem to flirt with me a lot (he's bi too) but it was casual flirting, if that makes sense.  For the past couple weeks ive had the butterflies BAD. It's to the point where I wake up and literally one of the first things I think of is him. I couldn't hold back anymore so last night I decided to make a move.  After some casual talk about various stuff, I got the courage to say he means a whole lot more to me than he knows. He began asking ""emotionally?"" In which I reply ""A little"" (I couldn't get the courage to say how much) in which he seems to have taken it pretty well so far. We didn't talk about it much though after that short moment though. We went back to talking about casual stuff.  He didn't show up to school today which is why I have the time to write this. But I have no doubt when he comes back he's gonna use this as ammunition to embarass me, as he usually calls me things along the lines of adorable and it usually flusters me, but I do like it.  I say ""kind of confessed"" since I'm not entirely sure it was a secret. I don't think he's that dense to not have noticed it before last night.

We've known of each other for a few years and we finally started talking 5 months ago! It was pretty off again on again and it was mostly just physical. He was able to open up to me (hes very confident and outgoing) and I was so intimidated and anxious around him that I was never able to really open up to him without it being awkward and uncomfortable.  I developed feelings for him a while back, but he said that he didnt want any relationship in his life, and so I never told him about my feelings. Now he is dating another girl, which hurts because he told me that he never wanted a relationship in his life in the first place and now hes in a relationship with someone else. I wish that he wouldnt have lied about not wanting a relationship because that made me feel terrible when he chose her over me. Because when SHE wanted a relationship he was willing . But with me, he just wanted everything physical. I went through a bad time: thinking about how she was better than me anyways and how I didn't deserve a good relationship in the first place. He did apologize in the end, and he says he wants to be friends. I dont know If I want to get hurt by him again.

I live with him, and his friends come over once a week to drink a lot. I am dreading the weekends now. I feel intimidated when I’m always offered to drink, even when I understand people are just trying to be good friends.

12314,"How much does environment affect your anxiety? - For the past couple of years I haven't been happy. I've spent numerous hours just thinking and pondering and wondering why I no longer feel enlivened the way I used to, many years ago. I'm 21 years old and I'm at a stage in my life where I'm starting to question the meaning of my existence. I've given it a lot of thought and come to the conclusion that maybe it's the place in which I reside that is the source of my mood swings and anxiety.  I was born in Toronto and am a visible minority. For anyone who has knowledge about the city, it's extremely diverse and teeming with all sorts of ethnic cultures. When I was only 2 years old, my parents, who had lived in the city for almost their entire lives, decided to pack up and move to a little industrial city on the south shore of Lake Ontario known as St. Catharines. I have spent the following years there ever since. Toronto is where I feel I belong, and I will elaborate on that below.  Most of my extended relatives live in Toronto. My family had work/personal ties to people living there, and for whatever reason it feels like they were happier living there too. I won't get into all the details but I'm mixed race and visibly appear to be of the visible minority side (half white, half visible minority). St. Catharines is a city primarily composed of aging, white, blue collar workers, and there seems to be an air of hopelessness in the city. Several years ago, a lot of the larger auto manufacturing plants here closed down when the whole NAFTA trade agreement came into play, costing people a lot of their jobs. As a result, there are a lot of people here on welfare or barely scraping by, which sort of lends this whole depressing atmosphere to the region. The suicide rate is also one of highest in the country, so I'm apparently not the only one who thinks the whole place is kind of a shit-show.  Jobs aren't really a thing here either, well, unless you would like to work retail or customer service call centre type jobs for the rest of your life. There's not much of a future here, a lot of the younger folk straight up move away because of the severe lack of good paying jobs. I had the opportunity to move back to Toronto a few years ago now and refused to take the opportunity for fear of accruing too much student debt. I've been kicking myself ever since, but that now begs the question: How much does environment really affect one's mood?  I'm not talking about personal relationships or how many friends one has, although that also plays a part in all this. I'm talking about demographics and small city living vs urban big city habitation. I enjoy the big city; every time I go back it just feels like home, even though I haven't lived there for most of my life. I feel like I'm missing out on all the action when I stay here, instead of experiencing the vibrancy and liveliness of a larger city. Part of it is just the fact that I feel alienated somewhat since I don't fit in with the rest of the population here. People here can be sort of naive, and it doesn't help that the local university has a large international student population that I get lumped into simply because of how I look. It kinda sucks when people don't really think you're a born and bred Canadian.  So, with all that being said, I think that while moving back to Toronto may not cure my anxiety entirely, it would certainly help a lot with my fear of people and interactions, and my unwillingness to go outside (and there's not much to do here anyway) with the exception of going to work/school. It may be expensive, but I feel like it would provide a large boost in quality of life, something I so desperately need at this point. I'm young, I should be out there experiencing new things and learning new ideas. I guess I just have to get over this fear of financially digging myself into an inescapable hole. The anonymity of a big city... it's attractive to me.  Am I alone in my situation? I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter. After all, that is why I'm making this post.",reddit,1,1

I'm 19 years old and am unable to get a job because my social anxiety is a big hindrance. I cannot keep eye contacts for more than 5 seconds at a time, my voice shakes and hands tremble when I enter an unfamiliar situation, and I have a constant fear that someone is going to yell at me or hit me for doing something wrong -- which is why I am always on guard. I also believe my sexuality plays a big role in it. I am a feminine gay boy and the public scrutiny makes me exceedingly apprehensive.

12317,"[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/user/LAHWF)  Alright Mr. Durden, while I agree with your overall point and strive to live this way myself, in my opinion you're omitting something very important, which sort of contradicts your argument.  &gt;Lose all hopes of being better, and you're suddenly free.  Yeah, but there are two outcomes of this. One, you gradually overcome all your fears and become the person you WANT to be, as you said, but two--you become depressed and then suicidal. I know because this is where I am now. I've always been a very ambitious individual with hopes and dreams, especially in regards to my career, but in the past couple of months I've fallen into a downward spiral of depression. I *have* lost all hope. I have none. I honestly think I'm gonna die before I reach the age of 25. There's just no way a person like me can survive. Everything I do is detrimental to either my physical or my mental health. I've accepted that I'm always going to be in this awkward, uncomfortable and confusing position of WANTING a certain kind of life, wanting to be so much more, to experience certain things, while also being unable to take any kind of action to achieve these things out of anxiety and fear, which, sadly, has been hardwired into my brain since birth. I'm not suicidal right now, but I have been before, and if I don't end up dying of some untreated illness or in some kind of accident in the next few years I think the most probable outcome is that I'll become legitimately suicidal and kill myself. By losing all hope, you are free from the fear of death, and free to take your own life.  This is why losing ALL hope is bad. You even say  &gt;Don't just be that person, want to be that person.  So in that case, if you want to be this person, you still have some hope left. Losing every single ounce of hope within you literally means just being the person you are without caring who that is because there's zero drive left in you. If recovery is a road and not a place, then not having any drive to be a certain person will leave you stuck on the side of the road. You will go nowhere for the rest of your life and you will die in the exact same spot you're in now.  INSTEAD...accept who you are now, lose all your optimism and pessimism and become a realist, take a look at the person you WANT to be, and completely ignore everything else.

12321,"Lethal combination of hairloss and Social Anxiety - Title is pretty self explanatory. My story is long and fucked up. I'm only 22 tho. So basically I first started having SA in the teens years and it has gotten progressively worse. I didn't really care about being awkward asf until a few years ago cus I didn't have depression back then. So basically from about 18-20 I would go out to clubs and hook up with random chick's. I would get hella drunk so that my SA went away and I basically used my looks to pick up chicks. Then suddenly end of summer 2018 BOOM my hairloss becomes noticeable and my partying career comes to a short, bitter end.   Before I just had SA but it was like meh who cares I'm asthetic asf I can just get drunk and bang random chicks. Now I still have SA BUT I no longer have looks on my side. And now I have depression too which was possibly caused by the hairloss I'm not sure. Basically I have to take SSRIs or its over for me. Goddamn how I wish I could go back to 2016-2018",reddit,1,1

And I usually answer pretty cold answers like ""good"" which makes me uncomfortable. But the thing that mostly disturbs me is asking them ""what's up?"" After they asked me. It's kinda weird , because they asked me first I'm kinda forced to ask them now although I don't care at all because they are strangers to me, and if I don't ask them it will look like I don't care (I really don't care) but I still need to make the impression like I do .. Of course if I really care about someone I would ask them but usually it's just makes me feel uncomfortable. Like I'm being a burden or pushing my nose to non of my business..

12323,"Severe anxiety spike in college - I was 19 when I went into college as a freshman and I really liked it. I was decently outgoing, joined a fraternity, and was having a good time. I don't know where everything went wrong but now i'm 21, a junior, and I hate college. I can never can bring myself to do anything because of nerves and anxiety. Every time my roommates successfully drag me to the bar, I leave within 20 minutes because the first awkward silence or awkward interaction I have makes me completely shut down and want to go home. Even with people I've been friends with for years, I can barely hold a good conversation with anymore, it doesn't feel natural like it used to. I'm starting to feel them getting irritated. I don't think they understand why I'm like this now either and I think they're starting to give up on reaching out and asking me to do things. I get so uncomfortable and nervous so fast and its so frustrating because I didn't use to be like this and it only points to getting worse. And of course as I'm sure all of you reading this subreddit know, thinking about it after just makes the anxiety worse. I get anxiety about my anxiety. It's a vicious cycle. My drinking and drug use (just marijuana now, I quit xanax last year) is the only thing that I want to do even though I know it is horribly unhealthy and making things worse. I'm just miserable and can't turn my brain off when I'm sober. I originally thought that maybe it was the xanax that was fucking up my anxiety but its been over a year since I took a xanax last and my anxiety is worse if anything. I saw a doctor today and she suggested I see a therapist and prescribed me zoloft but I'm not sure my family can afford these things. I'm just not sure what to do but something has to change and I was just wondering if anyone experienced something similar to this in college and has any advice. ",reddit,1,1
12324,"Potentially aspergers unless I'm completely mistaken.  Root event cause: I was bullied verbally in middle school from 6th to 10th grade and only a year after my dad died of cancer which I never got enough mental help for and meanwhile my mom was increasingly distraught and manical sometimes, so I'd come to school feeling very unhappy, which left me incredibly vulnerable to the usual mean boyish shenanigans that will go on. I was a computer geek who didn't know how to play sports and I was being reminded of that fact daily. I couldn't talk to people without them laughing because ""it was me"" who said whatever I said.  Also another factor: My dad was very avoidant in terms of eye contact and emotions. That affected me because he would often confuse me. My mom and dad also agreed that it wasn't necessary to form new friendships in the town I grew up in, so basically neither my mom or my dad when he was alive, had any local friends where I lived from 3 to 22. They were more asocial than I realized, and I think I'm really just carrying their torch right now.

I also hate traveling and being stuck in a car for hours while struggling with my GPS and praying that I don't get lost, so a group that meets in radically different places literally all over the state every few weeks sounds like a nightmare to me.  I feel like 3000+ members = lots of different types of people to meet, and I would say is worth the risk given your situation.  &gt; Movies - How can you make friends in a movie theater? lol  It's true, that most film groups will be gungho about films and will not likely talk during the screening. However, once it's done there's lots of interesting aspects about the film that can be discussed. Plus if you meet someone with similiar taste in movies, it's a great common ground to start a friendship on.  &gt; Soccer - I'm a scrawny dude with no athletic ability whatsoever. Don't feel like failing to keep up with everyone else and making a fool of myself.  I feel you here, I used to be terribly out of shape. I had finally joined a kickball team after much nagging from a friend (whom i had met at a film thing). It was great, everyone was older (20+) and it didn't have the same pressure of HS gym class.

How do you make friends while riding a bike? Plus, I live on the third floor of an apartment building and I don't have anywhere to put a bike, nor do I know of any nearby trails. Again, I don't feel like driving for an hour and risking getting lost just to ride a bike and then have to lug it around with me when I get back to my apartment.  Yes, I would agree that it is solitary. But with the club you can discuss techniques. If the group shoots film you can do darkroom photo development together. One of the best ice breakers in NYC was going upto random strangers and asking for their photo. People love getting their pictures taken (as you may have noticed on social media). I had only been declined once, and it wasn't embarassingbad at all  I would get an indoor bike rack where you can stand your bike or hang it on a wall. Again, I would say it's worth the risk. If you get really invested into biking, you can get some sweet bikes weighing in under 20. I would say fast riding can be isolating, but you take breaks together, and rides can be casual as well.   Typing this reply to you really hits home for me. I used to have a feeling of FOMO (fear of missing out), but i would tell myself some excuse not to get outside of my comfort zone.

I’ve been told that in order to lessen the anxiety I shouldn’t try to fight it but the act of not fighting it is only another way of trying to rid myself of it. I blow off my friends and family constantly and when I’m with them I rarely speak. I have found a group of very amazing friends and when I’m with them I contribute very little to the conversation. They think I’m just a quiet person but they have no idea I’m freaking out in my head constantly. I have so many thoughts, ideas, and emotions that I want to share with them but no way to do it.

People do describe me personable, but lately, I have been noticed a few quirks.  1. I cannot talk on the phone. I can do it with friends and family but not anyone else. I have a huge fear and I do not know why. I am afraid I'll say something wrong or people won't understand me.  2. I don't pick up on social cues like flirting. My parents say this. My GF says other girls do it to me and don't notice.  3. I don't have a ""best friend,"" someone to hang out with (besides my GF). I do hang around people but I do not have someone I talk to or contact on a regular basis.  4. I have a hard time asking people to hang out or asking to join a group.  5.

I'm 6'1"" and about 170lbs, reasonably athletic, and *try* to dress well.   I try to keep my life as average as possible. I don't go out of my way to seek attention, usually I'm happy to just do my own thing and let others do their. Well, life decided that was too much to ask for and decided to throw me a curve ball.  Ever since puberty kicked off, I've been developing into a man at a rate of about 1/16th of an inch a month.... go ahead and reread that, fire up your calculator, whatever you need to do.   My doctor can't find anything medically wrong with me, and all my blood work checks out. As far as he can tell this is just how I am. He's prepared me for the possibility that things may not slow down or stop until my mid-20s, although this would be rare.   But OP! That sounds like an absolute blessing and a dream come true for hundreds of people!! You should be thankful!!   Yeah well... it was fun at first, but when you have to wake up every day and face the world, all sorts of things get inconvenient very quickly.   There a dozens of issues I have to manage that most people don't seem to have to think about. Buying clothes is a nightmare. Exercise is uncomfortable. Sex and dating is a disaster. And the big one... society and people in general.   Society loves, *loves*, ***loves***, to obsess over this topic. Guys brag to anyone who will listen, truthful or not. Girls brag to their friends. Jokes are made everywhere. Media, especially music, won't shut up about it. All sorts of products promising to give you one are marketed universally. There are even categories of videos online dedicated to it.   ...and yet it is still a taboo topic to seriously discuss with nearly anyone, at least in the USA.   NO ONE seems willing to accept it may not be the most wonderful thing to ever happen to a person. But you won't even get that far because no one will believe you in the first place if you bring it up.   I've been harassed, groped, ogled, sneakily photographed, lost friends, dumped or refused by partners or potential partners, and caught in the middle of drama all because of it. I hate the attention it brings.   But people are SO stuck on the idea that it is a wonderful thing and can't possibly have any downsides that I've yet to find a single trustworthy person who's given me the time of day and just listened to me or let me rant or wanted to try and understand what I go through. So I just bottle it up inside and try to move on with my life and pretend it isn't a source of anxiety for me.  **TLDR: I've grown about 1/16th of an inch (yes...there) a month since puberty started (I'm 22 now) and it's more of a curse than a blessing. Society disagrees with me on that so the stress and issues it creates for me get bottled up inside, which isn't healthy for my mental state and makes me feel like an outsider, freakshow, whatever you wanna call it.**  So... thanks for making it this far and if you'd like to AMA then please do. Honestly anything, as long as it's respectful and genuine, will help take some of this stress off my shoulders at this point.  I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to move on past this hang up in my life? I have no idea how to handle this in a positive manner that doesn't result in fucking up relationships with friends, family, and partners. It just doesn't seem like something most people are willing to give the time of day and legitimacy to.

12363,"There is sadly no “cure” for any mental health related illness. The only tried and true real treatment for any mental health issue is therapy. Medications will always only mask symptoms, but the root is always there.   Sometimes meds are useful if you don’t have access to therapy and really can’t function to give you a “boost”, but the true intention of medication was always meant to be A.) temporary and B.) last resort only AFTER therapy. Sadly, many psychiatrists have abused this over the years because they used to get pay offs for prescribing (they don’t anymore as it’s illegal, but old school docs still do it out of habit and arrogance).  Nothing in life worth achieving is easy. Therapy is seriously hard work and exhausting. But think of it this way - if you can find a decent therapist who gets you and can help you, wouldn’t it be nice to to heal from the root issue and never have to depend on meds again? Especially if you’re ever in an emergency where you lose access to meds. Withdrawal exists on almost all mental health medications. It’s happened to me and it sucks.  I’ve been in therapy on and off for 20+ years and on almost every medication under the sun. I had to learn things the hard way. Going to school and majoring in the psychological field is what REALLY helped wake me up though to everything.  Never take a psych doc for their word. I always research anything before taking it now. Especially after doing just that - taking psych docs for their word and completely fucking up my chemistry. It’s just not worth it in the end.   Note: I’m exclusively talking about depression and anxiety. Things like schizophrenia or bi polar are in a different realm and they definitely need medication as research suggests those are in fact neurochemically based while depression and anxiety are more a result of environment and trauma.",reddit,0,1

That was something that pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to grow and seek out the things that were missing at the time , example. friends , girls , going out.

She suggested that I try cbt instead of psychoanalytical therapy and suggested me taking ssris to manage my physical symptoms and help stabilize my mood. The thing is, my mom is really against me taking antidepressants because she’s scared I’ll get addicted, and as I’m 17 it’s not really like I can make the choice myself. Even the psychiatrist tried to convince her and told her that she thought they would help me a lot and that she would be constantly monitoring my progress, but my mom is still not so open to the idea. I know that medication isn’t a cure-all and that there are negative side effects, but It’s just really frustrating knowing that I might be missing out on something that could potentially help me make progress after being anxious for so long because of my mom’s stubbornness. I understand her worry, I honestly really do, but I’m just so tired of knowing why I’m anxious and the root of my worrying without being able to much to combat my symptoms (not dissing my current therapist btw, she has helped a lot too lol). The compromise my psychiatrist and my mom worked out is that I’ll go to a trial CBT session next week and do a blood test to check that my anxiety isn’t linked to any thyroid issues.

I keep approaching people talking to them one on one as an equal and they retaliate as if I am a child. I mentioned to another acquaintance, oh I have a guy living with me now, a good friend from college. Her immediate reaction, You shouldn't have him taking advantage of you! Maybe her intentions were in the right place, but it seemed like she thought that it was impossible for someone to be living with me that wouldn't be taking advantage of me.

""I want to say hi to my coworker, but i dont want to say or do something cheesey. Nah nevermind they look mad anyway.""   - Taking a ridiculous amount of time contemplating how I should initiate a conversation with someone through text or online messaging, oftentimes taking days or weeks.  - Mental tug of war whenever im hanging around people due to the ""voice in the back of my head."" For example, im talking with some random person when suddenly thoughts like ""Shes ugly"" or ""this guy is a retard"" begin coming to my head and at the same time im thinking ""no shes not ugly at all."" Its like im trying to rationalize to myself that im not an ass hole, and im having a debate in my head while im talking to someone.  - Living in a constant state of fear of doing something wrong.  - Fear of expressing what I truly feel in social situations. In the rare event that i actually do express myself its extremely brief and not what I fully believe.  - Fear of being stuck in a conversatiom with one person for an undetermined amount of time.  - Because my social skills are complete trash atm, ive not had a girlfriend. The thing is that over the years many girls that had/have an interest in me, some of them downright telling me they like me. whenever it got to that point, I would begin avoiding that person even if I liked them back.  - I kind of said this before, but even the lightest of criticisms feel like someone is taking a knife to my chest, like seriously god dam.   - Learning to hide my social anxiety through putting on a hard front (I am muscular and large so that makes it easier). Thats the worst part to me though, absolutely no one that ive met knows that I have social anxiety. They dont know that Ive been living in a mental prison for the last 19 years (im 19 btw).

I'm just struggling in my current situation and I'm looking for help, and this just seems like a good way to get unfiltered input. Sorry if this isn't what I'm supposed to be posting or seems rude in anyway, I'm ignorant and desperate.  I've been struggling with social anxiety and depression for my entire life, and I've been seeking medical help for the past 5 years (I’m 21 now). I can’t function properly because of this, my subconscious just tears me apart in most situations. Nothing in particular triggers this, I’m just constantly uncomfortable outside of my room. I lose jobs because customers get aggressive and I start crying, I can’t use the bathroom when my roommate is home so I have to wait until the next day for them to leave, I’m completely incapable of making friends or forming relationships. It’s just hell, I don’t know how else to put it. I can’t support myself or pursue things I’m passionate about, and I’ve been trying so hard and in every way I can for years to fix this.  Talking to people is just a constant mental battle of “don’t give them a reason to hate you”, I’m saying and doing whatever I can to make that person like me more. All the while I’m sweating everywhere, my arms are shaking and my legs feel like jelly, and I’m too busy overthinking things to form coherent thoughts and struggle to speak without stuttering. Afterwards I’m full of regret and upset at myself for whatever minute thing I might have done to offend them, or how poorly I performed doing a very basic human task of having a conversation. I’m very self aware of this and it makes trying to continue pursuing these social interactions so discouraging.  My doctors have diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and social anxiety, and I’ve been prescribed every medication under the sun including controlled substances, none have lessened the effects. I’ve seen and stopped seeing 5-6 therapists now and all therapy seems to do is ruin whatever day my appointment is on. I've tried most common coping skills and practice some myself to help maintain functionality in stressful environments, but the collapse is inevitable. I’ve only been able to successfully cope with weed and self harm; weed is illegal in my state and while I have my own thoughts on self harm I’d like to stop it in time.  My main concern is not being able to support myself, people have suggested that I sign up for disability, which I guess is what I’m doing now. I hate the idea of someone sending me money because I “cry too much”, just makes me feel shitty knowing there’s people out there that would kill for my life. I’ve worked in IT, retail, fast food and sales and every one of them have ended with me crying in front of a customer and asked to leave or just stressing too much about the work to step foot in the door again after a bad day. In the past few months I’ve been trying to find ways to make money from home like selling game goods or freelance audio/video editing on Fiverr but this isn't nearly sufficient enough. I’m in school for NetSec and I’m hoping to land a job I can work from home in the future, but I don’t have a lot of confidence in things turning out ok.  It’s so discouraging to push for so long and see no improvement, and all I can do is rinse and repeat.  Now we get to chapter 2, the depression. I don’t want to get too much into it because you can likely fill in the blanks and there’s no sense complaining about it, but the gist of it is “If I can’t support myself or make friends or do anything outside of sitting in my room and crying, what do I do with my life?” This is constantly running through my mind, just hating myself because I can’t get basic things done in life and being disappointed at the results.  I don’t know what to do or try at this point, as I stated currently I’m signing up for disability but I’m not confident my request will be granted. I’m researching electroconvulsive therapy because… I don’t know what else to do, and I’m going to start asking my doctors for controlled substances. I obviously don’t want to get addicted to anything or see long term health issues, but like I said weed has helped so sedation = good I guess.  Any and all input is helpful and greatly appreciated.

But my problem is that I don't ever feel good or comfortable during these interactions.

I show less overt signs of anxiety, but I still get sweaty, flushed, and get an upset stomach.

Or what if something happens to her and I have to be the one to help because I'm right there, I can't handle that responsibility, would everyone hate me, would it be my fault if something happened to her? etc. When I lived in the dorms I lucked out and didn't have a roommate (dropped out before the semester started and never got replaced), and now it's not the worst cause as least we have separate bedrooms and just shared living space, but ugh.

A lot of people don’t understand what living with SA is like and how crazy it is that I have difficulty answering phone calls and texts, going to stores or even meeting deadlines. Things like this that you see other people do so easily that to them they cannot comprehend it. So to answer your question, medication definitely helps and journal a lot.

I want to go to my doctor about it because it extremely affects my sleep but I can’t find the strength to do it. Talking to people is the most anxiety provoking event for me. When I walk outside, I think people are starring at me or talking about me. I’m always afraid to say the wrong thing.

It’s becoming a problem because I’ll get really hungry or have to go to the bathroom and I’ll stand with my door on the handle until she goes in her room or leaves. I’ll be in my room for hours at a time. I’ve been here for a week and have talked to her twice. The one thing that helps me is listening to music with my headphones in. It really calms me down but I find myself in situations where it is rude to do so. I have spent the past year avoiding most social situations that now, I am in a position where I am in continuos contact with people and have to speak to them but I can barely put a sentence together. I never know what to say and it just makes me feel really awkward no matter the simplicity of the conversation. If I don’t know how to do something, I’m too afraid to even ask a question about it. I don’t want to mess up anything because it will make me anxious about having to do it again and it’s just a continuos cycle. I really want to make friends but not being able to talk to people is hindering that. Some days I just get in my car and cry because I don’t like living like this.

My dumbass self forgot that she was not comfy in crowds, and I suggested going for a music fest with a huge crowd for a second date. She then finally told me about her SA, and how it made her avoid crowds, and that she's about to start therapy for it, soon enough.

I’ve never partied in my life, never had a big group of friends except two best friends, didn’t hang out with my school mates outside of school, and I’ve never done crazy wild things like drugs or get blasted drunk or go on crazy adventures. I’ve never even been clubbing even though I want to. I’ve only been to a bar once and had two drinks.

12444,"Its really hard to pinpoint the exact moment or thing in your life that initiated SA, as it is something that develops the same way as a reflex. Therefore, it is a chain of events in your life, could be tiny, could be drastic, that cause you to develop SA.  For me, I can track it back as far as being the child of an overprotective mother that wouldn't allow me to go out and play with my school friends because she did not know them or their families, as well as being the one getting picked on in my sports team when I was young. Then I learned very recently that the growth of my SA got drastically accelerated when I was around 14 when I took prescribed pills against acute acne, which sent me into the darkest place I have ever been. I've only recently (a bout a year, now) been making good progress with my SA, and I'm now 22. I know its not going to disappear tomorow as, like I mentionned before, it is a reflex-like thing. A reflex takes time to adapt,so I know it will take a couple more years to get rid of my SA conpletely.

12446,"Hi, I know how you feel because I've been there. I'm someone that is in a relationship but let me explain to you the journey I went through. I had to get rejected by over 15 girls (girls that I actually went on dates with) before I ever had my first girlfriend. This is not including the ones that I asked for numbers/turned down date offers but ONLY the ones I got dates on - if this includes everything, I'd say a LOT more. I have reached the point where I am confident around people of the opposite sex and this level of achievement didn't come easily. I practised very hard to get my skills and confidence level up to this point. You say you want to be in a relationship but are you willing to put the work to reach the point where you can attract a member of the opposite sex to be with you? When you say you have a distorted view on your self-image whatever you believe is right, if you believe you can do it you are right - if you believe you can't do it, you are also right. Being in a relationship comes as a result of living an amazing life - your focus should be on yourself and not finding a relationship, when you start to do that magical things start to happen. So here's what you are going to do, first watch this video by Simple Pickup:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY3rT2N1Ecs  Then the next step would be to throw out wanting to be in a relationship, the more you want to be in a relationship the less likely you will be in one. WHY? You are coming from a place of need. The ONE thing that turns people off the most, guys and girls is neediness - DONT BE THAT GUY. You're going to go out there and practice your social skills, no matter how hard it is - you baby step your way. If you can't strike up a conversation with anyone, that's fine - you start with saying Hi and chatting for 15 seconds. This is a process. You're going to fail, people are going to reject your attempts - it's a guarantee. But remember, you are focused on your OWN self improvement and your OWN entertainment not anyone else. Remember why you are working for this: ""The master has failed more than the beginner/newbie has even tried"" While doing this process you also want to find hobbies and things you are love doing as a side, if you don't have any TRY NEW THINGS. This will make you a more interesting person in general, and in the process you will meet like-minded people that are in this journey to together. No need to rush the process of self-discovery, you really have to love yourself before anyone else can love you first - it might take 6 months, a year, 2 years - but it'll be all worth it. Definitely date around, talk with girls, talk with guys, get to know people - but there is no rush. When you focus on doing the right things - your mind and the world will create opportunities for you to take it. Be very aware of these opportunities and take them.

I am not embarrassed of her. I have issues in social situations/confrontations and try to get out of them.   I (22 years old man) decided to ride with her as she went to look at tables and get a few things. After going into both of the two major hardware companies (and panicing when anyone saw me and walked past me) I thought all was over and all would be okay except for panicing about   We go to Burger King and as always I try to get high up in the passenger seat so I cant be seen and judged on.  She waits until they come back as she wanted to ask for napkins about right here I cover my ears with both of my hands but I can still hear what's going on sadly. We get the napkins and she realizes no onion ring is in the bag. She tells them. They asked to look in the bag as they said they did put them in there. My mind is like hell for lack of a better term as I still have my ears covered. They get one and put it in the bag. Turns out it was a small instead of large.   I, politely as I could as I felt like my heart would burst out of me, told her to just go on or go in. I was fully panic mode at the time.  She jumps on me saying ""I cant even get what I pay for because of you."" ""You always act like you are embarrassed by me. Like I'm a failure in your eyes.""    No matter how much i open up to my mom about my issues she does this stuff or just tells me to get over it.  I value her thought so much because my father just has always looked at me like a failure.  When anyone criticizes me I feel like I can't do anything right.

Over time it will get easier and easier.  Joining club - NOPE. SA Drag me down too much it had stop me from joining a club. You can try hopefully you dont quit half way like i do..  Work in groups wow...survival mode.  I would strongly recommend to work in retail job. There you learn to create a persona. You will also gain social skills.

I'll do it, but i'll feel uncomfortable. I just feel like i don't really know how to act around people i don't know, or don't know that well. It feels like i'm never truly myself.

He always brags about being sarcastic and being the center of attention.  He was two years older than me, and he is 25 now. He used to get a ton of women when he was younger. He would brag about it and use women for sex and say he has no respect for sluts even though he tries to sleep around. He was in the military, but now in college, but he still drinks regularly and posts multiple pictures drinking on social media. His leading friend group is people from high school who were considered popular.  When he was younger, tons of girls wanted to date him, but it seems now that a lot of women block him or unfollow him. Also, now when he meets new women with his friends, they are disinterested in him. He even for bad eye bags now from drinking heavily. When I was younger, he told people not to say to people I talk to him because I was unpopular and would call me weird and annoying. He would ignore me after sex said I'm only suitable for sex.  Don't worry, I moved on and blocked him. Now he begs for us to talk again or acts closer than we were. I am asking to see me even with a girlfriend until I block him.

It was the late 90s so mental illness wasn't as big of a thing, but NO ONE diagnosed me and I never received early treatment. My childhood was a wreck. I would be punished for not speaking, teachers would gossip about me, doctors would either a) wonder what was ""wrong"" with me without trying to help find the cause or b) assume that I was just ""a shy child"", I was bullied and completely alone. **I** had to diagnose **myself**, at 14, when I stumbled upon one of those personality quizzes online. I feel like the system, people who were responsible for my early development, failed me. I didn't have a normal childhood and I grew up even more abnormal, and am now completely isolated with avoidant personality disorder.   Of course, at this point it is my fault too.

I have social anxiety and anxiety as well as slight depression and its been starting to become a big issue in my life so I'm looking on Reddit for some help. First off I have to say I've had anxiety basically since I was in 3rd Grade and it got really bad in 6th grade, started taking Zoloft and over time that started to help and eventually I felt fine. Fast forward to 2007 where I lived in a not so great environment with my mom, brother, and my moms friend as her roommate. There was a lot of differences between myself/brother and my moms roommate and eventually it got to a point where we just needed to get out of that hell hole as my brother and I like to describe it lol. We (My brother, My mom, and I) eventually moved in December of 2016 and got an apartment and things have been a lot better in that regards but as for my social anxiety its still a big issue.  I'm now 23 going to be 24 this year and still have never had a real girlfriend. I've talked to a few girls online that I've met in games I've played and had one that I thought was gonna the one. She lived in the same state (roughly 4 hours away), was a cute blonde and we had a lot in common. I messaged her online as well as skyped with her while playing games and eventually I got her number and we started texting all the time. In the morning before work, during work sometimes, after work till we both got on and played games and stuff together, we'd message each other/skype (voice chat) for a while and then she would need to go to bed. She'd always end up texting me like a minute later and we would text like all night. Eventually I brought up this LAN event I was going to attend and told her she should go. Told her we could get a hotel room so you don't have to spend as much and I'd bring a bunch of games like Mario Kart and whoop her ass lol. She said yes at first but the next day messaged me saying that she was gonna stay with a friend because she would feel more comfortable staying with someone shes met and knows (not that she didn't want to its just that we had never met before) and I understood so I told her that was fine and she said she would still hangout with me and we could play games and stuff. She eventually caught onto me that I liked her like a couple weeks before the event and told me she liked me too but was still also had feelings for her ex and doesnt want to hop into a relationship right away so she said we should get together at the event and spend time together and see how things go. Fast foward to the event (2015), we meet and immediately my brain shuts off and I just have like nothing to say. I barely got to talk to her at all that whole weekend unless it was through text because I'm a big puss. :( We hung out a little the last night she was there and that was probably the highlight of the trip. We got some pizza together, watched some hilarious YouTube videos together and played a board game with my friend I was staying with and 2 of his friends but it was too late because I got kind of fucked up the second night I was there and started texting her stupid shit I shouldn't have said like ""are we dating?"" etc... I cried for what felt like hours when she said we were just friends and that was by far the worst part of the that whole trip. Ever since that happened its been like imprinted in my mind and will never leave me. I was extremely depressed for like 6 months after that trip and her and I eventually stopped talking. I feel like I messed up that so badly that I just cant like forgive myself and I feel like I'm never gonna gonna find anyone like her ever again. She felt like the one but because I'm a socially anxious person I never got to talk to her and I never got to be with her and I never will and that depresses me to the point where I feel like I will never find a girl like her ever again. Someone I'm attracted to yet but has a ton in common with me. She felt like she was like a female version of me if you understand what I mean lol. And it just depresses me that I can never talk to her again and I never have another shot with her and I'll probably never find another girl like her ever again. I also started taking a Paroxetine hcl (paxil) that my Dr prescribed to me after not taking zoloft for probably two or three years about two months ago and that has been helping with the depression and has honestly helped me a tiny bit with my social anxiety but not enough.  This is where my problem is though. It's like I can talk to people through text but when I'm face to face (especially if its a girl I'm attracted to/like) my brain just shuts down and I have nothing to say. How do I get over this?

12500,"Finally Talking To My Doctor About Anxiety Today - Advice? - I have a doctors appointment this afternoon and I'm going to bring up my anxiety in hopes of maybe getting medication. A little backstory: I've struggled with both social and general anxiety for as long as I can remember...for most of my life I never even knew what anxiety was. I'm 25 now, and back in school they never taught us about mental health, they kinda touched on it, but I always thought the term ""anxiety"" just meant temporary nervousness. I thought I was a nervous person my whole life, then I discovered anxiety near the end of high school, early college. I still haven't gotten help though, but I'm really struggling as the anxiety interferes with my everyday life, my work, my relationships, it holds me back so much. I get irritable, overly stressed, worry about every little tiny problem, and on the physical side I get shaky, I stutter, my throat gets tight, my face turns red and hot, heart rate increases, and if it's really bad I cry and can't speak.  Anyone who's talked to their doctor about this, can you give me some advice or share your experience? I guess I'm just worried the doctor won't believe me? It seems like everyone has anxiety these days, it's almost like a trend to say you have anxiety and depression so I don't want mine to be written off. I rarely go to the doctor to begin with so I'm not sure how to start this conversation. I don't want it to sound like I'm desperate begging for meds or something, I just need some relief. Another reason I've avoided this is because I'm a little hesitant to go on meds, I know they can mess with a lot of people and I don't want to become totally dependent...another thing to worry about lol (thanks anxiety).  I also know therapy is super helpful too, but it's honestly something I can't afford right now, my insurance doesn't cover much. I want to get into therapy in the next year if possible but it's not an option at the moment. So I'd appreciate anyone's insight on this and how I can go about talking about anxiety with my doctor.

What I've been doing to become a more social person is go to the club's. I'm by no means a confident alpha male but I do dance and talk to girls even get number sometimes. But yea after quitting weed and going to club's often I started putting aside thinking I was socially anxious and anti social and just summed it up as I am just shy...,reddit,1,1

I’m at a loss of how to help him and perhaps need a different perspective.   My brother (15M) wasn’t always like this. When he was younger, he was able to talk to others without a hitch and could even make friends easily (or more easily than now). Over the last four or so years, he’s gotten more and more reclusive and hides away in his room unable to talk to others besides our immediate family. He dreads presentations at school, hides away in the library at lunch to avoid talking to/being around others, can’t order things he needs whether it’s food or talking to a cashier, etc. He is unable to ask questions in his classes to his teachers and his grades aren’t that great.   The most alarming signs are that he seeks food as a comfort to the point where he’s overweight now and he tried to self harm by cutting himself around last year but I thankfully caught it in the early stages and he’s since stopped. He’s turned to video games as well and barely speaks to us. It’s incredibly difficult for him to open up and share his feelings and I’m worried most about that aspect. I’m the closest to him and yet it’s like pulling nails to get him to tell me what’s wrong and that he’d rather keep it all to himself.   I’ve tried to intervene and help him by taking him on a shopping spree to make him feel better about himself and spend time with him everyday so he knows he has someone who he can always come to for anything. I’ve taken him to my therapist (more like forced him to come with me) and he opened up but isn’t all that keen on going back and continuing. I’ve tried to get him to do activities with me so he’d get some exercise in because I know if he’d get moving, he’d feel a whole lot better in general. He refuses and won’t come along with me so I’m really at a loss about this issue. Our parents swear nothing is wrong even though there’s clearly an issue and I’m afraid if he continues like this, it’ll take a lot longer to correct. I don’t want him to get bullied or hurt because of this; he has a soft heart and it would destroy me.   What are some things I can do to help him? Everything I’ve tried hasn’t really come to fruition but I don’t want to give up.   TLDR: Brother refuses any help I offer to help improve his condition.

They called it (the author of the study) metacognitive therapy developed specifically for social anxiety treatment.

So each experimental group has about 25 participants.  At the end after dropout there were more like 20.  How confident are we that comparing one group of 20 to other groups of 20 can be extrapolated to all people with SAD?    Also, if you look at the numbers, the people on medication improved more than people only receiving placebo.  So the medication is doing *some* improving (according to their own little study).    So what broad conclusions can be drawn by psychology?  Probably something like, intriguing small preliminary clinical study.  Future larger studies replicating this study should be done.

All I needed to do was to go over, politely hand the music to her, maybe even say something nice and walk away having made a good impression. And yet, here's what I did: I went over with the music. Then I had a complete mental block. Instead of just saying ""excuse me"" or something I kind of just waved the music sheet around and mumbled ""here's some music"" to get her attention. Then she looked up at me, looking confused. I somehow managed to get the music sheet into her hand, and mumbled ""sorry, that was weird"" and started to walk away.

I just can't really talk or trust them. Maybe that is the reason why I am so socially awkward and axious.      I got to meet my old friends since I'm back in town, and for a while they were like my family we used to hangout have a few smokes and drinks and had lots of fun, but then they betryaed me, they got inside my house while everybody were away and stoled money from us. They think i don't know about it, but i do, i not talking to them anymore and now i just have to pretend like everything is fine when they try to talk to me.     My new friends at school were nice, until they started excluding me form their social circle and one of them started dating the girl that i liked, even though he knew it, they also hurted me in other ways but I am in tears right now and very sad to tell you about them.        I had my first kiss last week, this girl is really nice, i feel like a might really like her, but she doesn't like me as much. It hurts to know that, i just wish i wish could not give a fuck about her because i know that i will get hurt, just like i am right now. But i just can't. She talk about her previous experiences with other guys, and it just hurts so much when she starts saying stuff like ""I sucked my ex bf dick one day and it was like that"" and she asks if i am fine with her talking about that kind of stuff and I say that I am, even though i am not. I feel like she is just going to hurt me and I am scared.     It's been a while since a felt genuine pleasure, I felt nothing with that kiss just like and don't feel pleasure from masturbating or playing the piano, or gaming, or studying stuff that i like, i don;t recognize myself when i look at the mirro, i just feel so numb and empty sometimes i feel happy but i know that is just because I fotgot it all for a second. It's like every week, every day, every minute it just gest worse and it's never getting better i don't think that one day I will feel something. That's much more to this story but like i said i don't think i can handle writing it down, to be honest i dont't think anyone will answer this and that for some people, what i said just doesn't sound that hard, maybe they are right. they are probably right, but it just hurts so fucking much. Maybe i deserve this. I' ve been considering hurting myself phisically. I don't think that i lived a life that was worth living and i don't think that i will one day. I just feel lonely and hopeless, i want it to stop,i want just to sleep forever, never see tomorrow. Painless.     Sorry for all the misspelling, i'm not correcting them because this is just so i can feel better about myself, no one is coming to save me, i just wish i could put in words everything that i been through and i think all of my thought.",reddit,1,1

12564,"How is your anxiety with other stuff? Like are you able to go shopping, make a doctor's appt, etc. If that stuff is still too hard, def try those ""baby steps"" first so that you feel more confident about putting out applications. Usually retail/UPS/FedEx/Amazon/doctor's offices are where young people your age first start working. Start with making a resume, though honestly some places like Amazon don't even require a one!   I also have severe SA and I started working at a grocery store when I turned 18. It's been almost 3 years and I'm still there. It's been hard and shitty at times, but it's seriously so worth it. At least do it for the money lol making money is awesome!   All it takes is just looking up stores in your area and putting in an online application. Try to avoid fancy household names and fashion stores since those kinds of stores tend to have actual standards for their employees. Walmart and other random grocery stores (besides Trader Joes and Whole Foods) are usually not picky and it's very easy work. Fast food and fashion can be easy depending on the chain, but def get the vibe of the employees first. Some chains have terrible turnover and it shows if every employee is just super rude and miserable. Decent places will have generally normal, polite employees.  If you want some practice, you can try calling some places and asking them directly if theyre hiring. Trust me only maniacs would respond rudely to that question! If anything they'd just say ""we arent hiring right now""/""call again when the managers here""/""its all online."" If they say theyre hiring, ask how you can apply and any next steps that they recommend. Usually calling and following up on an application can show interest. I know my boss sometimes doesn't look at apps until she gets called about it. If you go in person and make sure to look nice and friendly, it'll be even better. You can get a sense of the vibe of the employees and maybe some useful tips and advice from them.  In low-wage jobs honestly the interviews are rarely as high-stakes as the internet makes you believe. Mine was literally just getting my papers in and picking my hours. Just be positive, be clean, act normal, and don't say that you hate customers or have problems with being late. Definitely don't mention shyness or other personal issues.   It's really so much easier than it sounds! And once you get the job it really just becomes a routine like any other.

Or, worse, it looked like I wanted it to be relevant while it really wasn't, which made me seem dishonest or stupid, etc. sigh  I'm interested in CBT. I should probably contact my doctor. I appreciate your perspective, but I'd like to explain my view on the matter.  You see, while much of my fear of embarrassing myself when I speak up or act is irrational, not all of it is. My anxiety doesn't come out of nowhere; I have embarrassed myself before. In fact, I can trace it all back to my youth.   Also, you're generalizing when saying that people don't care about what you say to them: many don't but some do. I know they exist because I'm one of them: I pay attention to what people say to me. Most of the time I start finishing their sentences before too long. I'm sure I'm not the only such person around (in fact here in college I'm surrounded by them), so I'm anxious about what I say to *those* people. They will analyze my words just as much as I'd analyze theirs.   In my experience people always judge what other people say, if they *can*. I don't judge what a certain politician says because I'm not familiar with the details. While arguing among friends, I *am* going to judge what arguments they use and I *will* remember that. Not just as potential joke material, but also to build up a prediction of how reliable this friend is, or at least how good at arguing. It's these kind of memories you use while trying to think how this friend might think about something, for instance how they'd interpret my own arguments. That's how I think of 25 reasons not to say something. I don't want them to think badly of me, so I need to watch my words.   Kind of the same happened with the haircut story: just replace my friends with reddit (the general populace) and it works.   I could go on and on about this, but it's late and this comment is getting kind of long anyway. Again, I appreciate your perspective. I wish I could just stop caring about what others think, but I'm afraid that's not going to happen for some time. It's part of who I am at this point. ",reddit,0,0

12575,"Social Anxiety Is Ruining My Life - I've always had problems talking to people and forming interpersonal relationships, but it's now at a point where it's safe to say that it is ruining my life.   I only have two people that I somewhat regularly talk to, because they're friends from all the way back in elementary school. My family life is fucked, I live alone in a small apartment and talk to them only very occasionally. The only person from my family that I have a deeper connection with is my twin sister, who however has moved to the other side of the country, so I only see her very rarely. Even she doesn't know of the full extent of my anxiety and depression, I think she just thinks that's just who I am.   I just turned 21 now and I'm about to finish up an internship at an IT company, that I luckily got not because of my social skills, but because I was top of my class and they offered it to me because of that. Just like with every other job/school I've been to before though, I talk to no one unless it's absolutely necessary and I have to do it because of the job. I feel uncomfortable and don't feel like I can relate to anyone there, even though they're not bad people or anything.  Now my supervisor came up to me last Friday and told me that while I do my job well, I won't be able to get a full time position after the internship (which was the mutual plan from the start) because of my lacking social skills and me not talking to anyone. This honestly didn't surprise me that much, but it still hit me like a brick. I was trying to hold back tears and felt completely dumbstruck for the rest of the day, not because I want the job so desperately, but because this is the nail in the coffin in my realization that my social anxiety is absolutely ruining my life.   I am dealing with depression because of how miserable my life is and because of how terrible it feels to miss out on life. Life is passing me by and I watch every year go by with minimal change. I've never even kissed a girl, I spend most of my time playing computer games or browsing the internet, because I have nothing else to do. The thought of engaging in social activity, let alone go to parties or something, ignites instant panic in me.  The thing is that my supervisor offered to give me one last chance to better my social behavior in the remaining 1.5 months of my internship. He's surprisingly nice considering that most people usually write off my social anxiety as ignorance, and I don't hold a grudge against him for not wanting to employ me, I honestly probably wouldn't employ myself either. He recommended me to join an acting club because he believes that would help, but honestly that just made me panic and I can't even see myself doing something like this. I think I literally couldn't do it. He said I should think about it over the weekend.  So what do I do? I can't see myself joining an acting club, the thought of that alone frightens me and I think I would only leave even more retreated in my shell. But if I say no that would show them that I'm not trying to better myself. The thought of seeing a therapist sounds more promising to me, there would be less pressure and I could try to figure myself out as to why I am like this. I definitely think it has to do with past experiences in my life, I developed trust issues from an abusive mother that might have developed into me not being able to get personal with anybody.  Then again I started questioning if it might be better if I don't even try to stay at that company after the internship. People there, while nice, already have the impression of me being a freak, and the longer I know people the harder it is to be myself around them after all this time. I might need a fresh start or just some time off for myself to really self reflect and get a handle on things. I just want to start living and stop this endless cycle of mundane existence. Regardless, tomorrow I have to tell my supervisor what I have envisioned for the future, and I still don't know.

Thankyou for sharing that. Just a thought with the telephone interview, you might want to practise just picking up the phone with nobody on the other line, just so you get used to talking on the phone. Then, you could practise with a friend or family member, like mock questions or something. I'm not sure if that was helpful or not :(   I know that a lot of jobs focus on 'confident and charismatic' people, but, at least for me, people who are generally quieter or anxious like myself tend to be more compassionate and considerate to others.  They may be better listeners, and pay attention to detail. Just try and focus on your strengths! I know that can be very hard, but you have skills and talents that other people don't, and you can play an important role, no matter how insignificant or unhelpful you may think it is.

12580,"What the hell actually happened to me...? - So I'm a 20 year old male with crippling social anxiety. I haven't had a job yet because the thought of having to do the very first interview with an employer kills me. It also doesn't help that I don't really have anything that I want to work towards, other than my stupid ""dream job"" that I can't even decide whether its just my fantasy, or something realistic...  Now I grew up on movies with actors like Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, and Robin Williams and from a very early age thats what I wanted to do for a living. I loved being funny and entertaining people and making them laugh. Even to this day, thats the best thing that I can see myself happily doing for the rest of my life, either being a comic or at least coming up with and making comedies.   Now I was always a shy kid, but once I got to warm up to the people around I became the star of the show... I was really confident and well liked by my classmates back in grade school, but everything kinda changed over a year or 2. I later became kinda depressed and it caused me to close up from people. Now as a 20 year old I literally freeze up when talking to people, even if its with a relative that I haven't seen in a while.   I know I still have my humor because I bring all that energy when hanging out with my very close friends, but I just can't bring myself to even 1% of that when I'm around people.   I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I have no confidence nor the motivation to do what I've wanted to do since childhood.

My problem/s are probably pretty damn idiotic compared to some much more serious issues others here might have, but well.  Basically, I am 17m and I negin to think ( for like half a year now ) I may have social anxiety or something similair and want to set myself free. I don't think It's something very serious, but It still is a burden to me. Ok, I noticed my ""problems"" back at a school dance last year. Everybody was having fun, they danced, drank and had a good time. Not me though. I just couldn't get there. Also on other occasions, I just become someone else. Normally I am, at least I hope, a good friend, someone reliable, who's there for you. But at ""Events"" such as this. I just am dragged down, depressed and also somewhat angry and rude. You know, the opposite of what you should be in that situation.   I am so lucky, and I know that. That I have some really good freinds who I can have fun with on normal occasions. If it's not event esque. Also you know, they all drink a good amount there, and have fun. Once some of us would sit at McDonalds at night after some bowling. And there they were like talking about what kind of ""drinking stories"" they had and some experiences with weed and stuff. At that point, I again wasn't myself, I tried not to talk anything, i didn't want to insult anyone. My right hand started trembling and I couldn't really do anything. Where am I, why am I here, What? All of that. This went on for probably an hour. Everybody was driving home, I agreed to drive one of them ( my probably closest friend there ) home. She knows about my issue, made sure I was ok, gave me some water. I couldn't be more thankfull, but still she doesn't know how this is, thus cannot really help me.  I began to evaluate, what is my problem? I concluded I most likely have some sort of social missbehavious or something. Since I also am afraid of organizing meet ups and stuff, I mostly just ""go there"". I know compared to some people here I sound like a complete idiot.

When I was young I constantly wished I was never born and felt like I was a burden to everyone the way that you described. I was more extroverted growing up, but overtime my social anxiety has turned into this film over my personality that has caused me to be antisocial. It’s manifested into something much worse. I’ve been going to therapy consistently for about 8 months or so, and I wish I would’ve started sooner. So many awful habits and thought distortions built up over all of those years feeling this way. In the past 8 months, I’ve made a little progress that has made some days easier, but there’s still a long way to go to feeling somewhat “normal.”  I saw someone else above gave great recommendations on things you can do without going to therapy (since you don’t want to discuss this with your parents). Since you’re 18 now, you may want to see if there are any options to find therapy without your parents knowing. I’m still on my parent’s insurance, and they would have no idea I go to therapy if I didn’t tell them. Good luck!",reddit,1,1
12587,"Questions for Users of Inderal (Propanolol) - Hey everyone, I'm a high schooler who suffers from mild-moderate social anxiety, accompanied by pretty bad performance anxiety. I really want to participate a lot more in class, and I know that it would be good for me, but I feel like I'm being held back by my anxiety. Whenever I feel like I can adequately answer the questions of another student or the teacher, I feel like raising my hand, but I usually don't because my heart will start racing and I'll start sweating and shaking a bit. For the times that I have participated in class, I notice that my voice doesn't quiver so badly but that is only because I am decent at disguising my fear, and my heart will still be racing, I'll shake, etc. I feel that if I can get rid of the physical symptoms, I'll be so much better off. So I have done some research and found Inderal (propanolol) as a potential treatment.  TLDR - I suffer physical symptoms of anxiety.  I'd like to know some things before asking my mom for a prescription:  -Have you noticed any long-term side effects and/or negative effects from daily usage?   -Is there an age requirement to take Inderal? (I'm under 18)  -How did you acquire Inderal? Did you have to talk to an anxiety specialist and get a prescription, or can you ask your regular doctor (pediatrician in my case) for a prescription, explain your situation, get it and leave? Or, can you even walk into a pharmacy and get some after explaining why you could use some, and would the Inderal in that case be covered by insurance?

12591,"Old Social Anxiety Feelings Coming Back - When I was younger, I had symptoms of social anxiety. I worked through these problems with a therapist, and now I’m pretty much healed. But some things have been happening lately that are triggering some old feelings.  I quit playing basketball as a teenager because of said anxiety feelings. At the start of the year, I went back to playing basketball. I thought it would be good because physical activity can help mental health problems, and I saw it as a good opportunity to meet other people and get involved in a community. I’m 23 years old and all the other players on the team are 16 years old. The coach asks me to give the other players a lift every week but as soon as they’ve said hello to me, they sit in the back seat and talk to each other. They always sit in the back seat, too, even if the front seat is free. Makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. They get out the car and walk ahead of me into the stadium talking while I’m still getting my bag out of the car. I’ve tried small talk attempts but I only get one word answers. I know that I was pretty awkward like them at 16, especially due to the fact I had anxiety, but I’m starting to think they’re being quite rude. On the rare weeks where I don’t give them a lift, they make blunt comments on court like “that was stupid” or “what are you doing?” to me and no one else. And I know that I’m not a bad player or anything. I score as many points as anyone else, I don’t hog the ball, and I try to be friendly and encouraging.  I just don’t get it. The club asked me to manage the team and wanting to break into the community, I said yes. Sometimes it seems like nobody cares about the team except me, and to be honest I don’t really care that much, I feel like I’m only caring as much as anyone else should. The other players often tell me they can’t play due to sickness or injury an hour before the game. One game I arrived at the end of the first quarter because I needed to find a fifth player for our game. I was incredibly frustrated because the game took place an hour away from my home. The team was down by 20 when I got there because we started with 4 players. I was feeling pretty down by then and had no motivation to play well. I sat away from the team during time outs. The coach asked my partner about me later on in the week when he bumped into him but never said a word to me. This really upset me so I refused to play the next week. They didn't take me seriously until I didn't message them with game details the night before.   I trained with another team in the club the other week and they were so encouraging to each other and very welcoming of me. Too bad I can’t play for them because I’m the opposite gender.

For some reason it has always been difficult to connect with other people and feel and sense of belonging. This has gotten worse as I've gotten older.   I do have bad social anxiety, and because of that I actually isolated myself for an entire year once. Consequently my social skills have deteriorated. Every day it feels like they are getting worse. I also deal with a lot of brain fog..  It feels like my brain is falling apart.  I find myself riddled with anxiety in any type of social context difficult. When im talking to people online, I'm always worried about small things like wondering things strangely or saying too much in a message.  When in a social situation in person, it's like I'm outside of myself and cringing at myself. When it's particularly bad, the walls become suffocating. Also, this might sound weird, but it's like I can physically feel my own awkwardness. And that's just being around people.  When I actually talk to people, I mumble and stammer and sometimes forget my words mind sentence... So I usually avoid talking at all.  I do have 'friends', but I'm not vey close with any of them. They also never reach out to me and ask what's up or how things are going... It genuinely feels like if I disappeared, no one would notice; or if they did, they wouldn't be bothered.

12598,"I have no friends and I feel lonely - * Post is going to be long and thank you to anyone who actually reads all of it   Okay so I’m 19F and I have no friends. In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with.  They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. Sometimes I think that the best I can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company I work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever.  Sorry for this long ass stupid rant. Goodbye Im sad as fuck now low key crying and depressed:)))) ",reddit,1,1
12599,"Is this something to be ashamed of? - I’m almost 23 and I have NEVER had a job because of my social anxiety. Ever. I wish I was kidding. I’m embarrassed by this. When people ask me if I go to school or have a job, I never know how to respond to that. I’m terrified of working with the public. I suck enough as it is being a customer in places, I can’t imagine being the employee especially with how shitty people are these days. I also have this thing where I absolutely cannot work under pressure, like with people watching me and waiting on me. I don’t know what to do.

As some already said you can begin by getting a mediocre job, so you can cover your own basic needs, like your own food, a place to live, paying the bills, etc. This is when adulthood begins. It would only happen if it becomes a necessity, so maybe ask your mom to help you find a job rather than give you money. Once it becomes necessary for you to work and make your own money you will find a way to deal with your social anxiety. There are lots of books and advice on how to cope. The difference is right now, you can quit your job, or whatever makes you uncomfortable and come back to your comfort zone ( your mom protection) but when you know there is no protection anymore, you won’t easily quit!",reddit,0,1

12609,"Can anyone please help me? - I am a 17 year old girl. I have so much insecurities about my looks for example my skin, forhead, nose, lips etc...   It started with my nose that I hated since I was a child that I would cry because I didn't like it. But in recent years since I started high-school my insecurities increased.   When I was 14 years old I remember sitting in my bed and crying because of my nose, and my imperfect skin. So months later I started living in a fantasy world where all my insecurities were fixed, my nose was smaller, skin tone was even, my hair was thicker and healthier etc. At first it was something I did once in a while but then it increased it became almost an addiction. I would spend hours everyday where I close the lights in the room lower the temperature, lock my door and play really loud music while I pace around my room, escaping into my fantasy world. I feel so amazing when I daydream it feels so real for me. The problem is that now my insecurities increased, especially that I can detach from my body so easily. I don't look in the mirror for days, I sometimes can't shower for a whole week not because I am dirty but because I don't like the fact that my skin tone is not the same everywhere and because it is not perfect. I can't study well because whenever I try to come to real life I feel so sad because I feel like I am crazy for living in a fantasy world I feel so bad and so much regret and this makes me want to escape life again.   But this had also made me lose my concentration and I literally don't remember anything at all. I don't even know what I am saying, I forget things that I did in the past and where I placed stuff etc. If u can see how messy this post is it is literally how my brain works  Another problems is that I literally keep remembering the bad things that happened to me all the time when I am in the real world  I believe that I have two faces my pretty face and my ugly face my pretty face is skinnier and with a smaller nose etc.. I feel when my face is the pretty one so I can look in the mirror and can be more productive and confident. But when I have my not pretty face I feel so down and I can't do anything, I can't go out in public, I sometimes cancel going out or feel so nervous and scared. I once was so nervous to go to a party that I started crying in the car. I am so sure about the pretty face thing because even my father noticed and he told me that my face looks different during not pretty face period and during my pretty face period after days later he told me that my face got smaller.  I try to fake it and act normal when I am with others so no one knows that I suffer every single second of my life. Especially that I go out during my pretty face times so I am more confident and they don't notice.  I am determined to have a nose job, I even chose my surgeon. I feel like I will be happier after my nose job.  I hate cameras so much, I don't like taking pictures and videos or look at old photos at all. I rarely take selfie and they are mostly through specific angles. I don't like opening cameras in online classes, and if I had cameras open I feel so nervous and my heart keeps beating for the whole class. I hate going out because of cameras.  I feel so embarrassed by my daydreams but to be honest they make me happy.  My fantasy world reached a point where I would lie about things that happened to me in real life but they actually haven't. I sometimes believe what happens in my dream world. I am literally addicted to my fantasy world  I am even scared to show my face in public, especially after the masks thing  Nowadays I don't have this as much thankfully but last year for many many months I had sleep paralysis and nightmares almost every night.  I can only look in the mirror if I pinched my nose every few seconds to make it look smaller. I have only seen my nose unpinched only 2 times maybe in the past years. I know it is terrible but I really don't like my natural nose. I also have to smile a certain way because I don't like the way my lips look when I have a straight face. Looking in the mirror has so much rituals for me.  I also don't like my feet and that is why I wear socks all day so that not me or anyone can see them.  I also don't like real life because I feel so alone and scared, unlike in my fantasy world.  I sometimes feel suicidal and have urges to cut, I brought a knife and placed it in my wrist multiple times but I thankfully didn't actually cut, I also feel like if I started cutting it will make marks in my skin and people would know aswell as ruin my skin and make me even more insecure about it.  My fantasy world seems so real to the point that I once cried so bad when one of the people in my world died. I love my characters so much, because they actually help me, unlike in real life where I don't have anyone to tell.  I am about 100lbs and people tell me that I am skinny but I rarely see myself as so. I know that I am skinny but I don't feel it. I don't believe I have an eating disorder because my whole diet consists of sodas and sugars and I don't really care as much. I don't like salads and vegetables and I rarely cook because it also puts me.in real life  I keep getting these moments when I feel so nervous and scared for no reason and start to cry. I have no idea why   I had tried to meditate and pray but I can't for many days because it makes me go into reality and it feels scary for me.  I get intrusive thoughts about my looks all the time. Like for example my brain tells me that I will never be pretty enough. And when I see models my brain tells me that I will never be like them.  I am tearing up now and I honestly didn't tell anyone about this, I told my parents that I needed therapy but they won't let me go to because they don't think there is anything wrong with me. Also both my parents are doctors and my mom would tell me (since I was young) that if I had any problems I should tell her. I do tell her about almost everything except this thing because it's embarrassing and she also has her own problems so I don't want to worry her. I dont want to self diagnose but I can't go to a psychiatric or psychologist, so does anyone know what should I do. I really want to become better but I am scared  I don't care about my looks for other people but mostly to myself because I know that most people are not perfect and I honestly don't understand how they are OK about this, I feel like I should be perfect in every aspect, looks, education, clothing etc..",reddit,1,1

12614,"Why am I so terrified of this guy I like? - So, I'm currently in a complex situation with multiple guys I like, and I'm addressing that in a different sub. But this, right here, is 150% SA. I can just tell.    So there's this one guy who somehow scares me. He hasn't done a single thing that's alarming or weird, but I can't stop freaking out.    He ""asked me out"" three-ish times in the last week, all over text. Today he asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow after he gets off work at 8. While part of me definitely wants to hang out with him, there's this large part of me that's like this:    1) What would my parents think if they knew I (a little 18 year old) was leaving my dorm at 8 to meet some 21 year old dude? What if I don't even know how to be an adult? That reeeeallly makes me start to panic...    2) What if he's a bad driver (cars are a major source of anxiety for me) I do not want to die. On that topic, what if he tries to kill me, or worse? I have not trained / prepared enough for situations like this, and I don't have my pepper spray. But also....   3) Why don't I trust this guy? He seems so nice, genuinely nonthreatening and very chill. What does it say about me that I immediately think nice people want to hurt me?    4) What will he want to do? If I have to pay to do something, I only have NINE DOLLARS in my wallet since I stopped working, and I can't use my credit card because my mother tracks the payments....   5) What if he doesn't like me, or vice versa? What if our chemistry is awful?   Basically, I'm completely strung out worrying about this. I'm scared because I haven't met this guy face to face. I know him through a bunch of friends' of friends', and he seems so nonthreatening, but how can I be sure? Also, I'm worried about physically leaving my dorm and going out into the real world where everything is so big and loud and real. I know that sounds cliche, but seriously, I'm absolutely terrified. Part of me just wants to curl up and watch netflix on my own, like I do *every single night*...  However, there's that part of me that really wants to go. It keeps telling me that I'm never going to learn how to act in the real world if I didn't push myself out of my comfort zone. This guy could be really fun and cool to hang out with, and I won't know unless I go.   What do you all think? I have social anxiety, but I'm going completely un-medicated. Times like these I wish I could just take something and have everything make sense, but that's not going to happen so it's not worth discussing. I just have to push through this like medication wasn't invented.    If anyone has any insight, tips, advice, whatever, please, I would appreciate it so incredibly much. Thank you in advance.

Everything that could go wrong goes wrong... It's not cute.   So throughout freshman year, I had a number of presentations assigned to almost every class. This is embarrassing to admit, but I failed 4 of my classes, because I never showed up for my presentations, which resulted in failing 4 classes. I am not a bad student, like I WANT and WISH I could succeed and complete my presentations, but my social anxiety is so bad to the point where I literally would rather take the F's than to present in front of my classes. But college is too much money to be doing that obviously. And I know that there will obviously be more presentations in the future, so how can I get through this and not fail my classes. I can't just avoid them, but is there something I could tell my teacher or someone? I just don't want to be the only one not presenting, and then people wonder why I got out of it you know?

In high school I did have a group of girl friends, however after school ended the friendships faded away.   I’ve noticed that currently in my life I only have male friendships and the people that approach me are only males. I wanted to know if there’s any reason for me not gaining friendships from girls? It is always men that will approach me and will check on me, how I am doing and will be there for me. However women in my life do not do this, and are cold towards me. Even if I do make a connection with a girl, we usually stay as acquaintances.  Any ideas guys? I wish I had girlfriends to hang out with and talk about like-minded things.

I'm 21 now and have never been in a relationship before, but I'm always on the look out for ""the one.""  I'm currently taking a class that meets only one day of the week and there's a girl in this class that, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful people I have ever seen. She smiled at me the first day without even knowing me. Last week I finally decided to talk to her since she is taking a film class I took a couple semesters back. We talked briefly and had a really good discussion with shared views on many things. I've never had an interaction like this with really anyone, let alone somebody I'm interested in. My mind has now gone a bit crazy this last week, with my anxiety off the charts thinking about doing anything. I'm also overweight which causes some self-image issues with this situation.

I'm so nervous to try and ask her out or anything, but I also feel like I may regret not doing so for a very long time.

Anyways I’ve always had bad really bad social anxiety for as long as I can remember but I never struggled with making friends. During my childhood, I was often hailed as one of the “cool” kids.  I never understood why, I was always unhappy because I could never relate to anybody or connect to anyone on a deeper level, I was often just liked because I was loud and obnoxious or because I am tall and people take notice when your tall.  The only reason I was loud and liked to cause trouble was because I was unhappy with my real personality but I didn’t think of it like that until now since I’ve thought about it.  I’ve been called handsome and have had no problems with girls as well until recently.  During high school and middle school I was on the basketball team which made me popular I guess and when ur on the team and have had girls before I guess people expect you to be a certain way. The problem is, I’m just a weird guy who’s extremely introverted, I just enjoy playing video games by myself most of the time. I was able to get by during my school years bc I was constantly around others and could meet ppl and make friends, but now that I am in college, I have realized that I never actually meaningful connections to anybody and it was all circumstance.  A year has passed since high school and it’s very rare that I am asked to go out by anybody these days when that was normal back then.

Aside from two friends in middle/high school, I've been a loner my whole life. I've never had a girlfriend or any other friends, though I've been in a lot of clubs and activities.  I get really self-conscious/nervous and red-faced when doing simple tasks, like walking down a busy street, talking to someone else in class, introducing myself, answering a teacher's question, ordering coffee/food, etc. I've quit some activities/clubs I used to enjoy because of this. Now I do them alone.  Not long ago, I was in a class where our grade came from group work. We had to get into groups of 3 or 4 people and work on a project/assignment. I didn't know anyone, so I went up to one group and asked to join. They said, ""sorry, we have enough people"". I went to another group, and the said the same thing. Everyone in the lecture hall was glaring at me, and the two groups were apologizing to me. I just grabbed my stuff and left. I dropped the class the day after out of embarrassment, and I'm delaying my graduation to avoid taking a class with group work from now on. This is the second time in my life (first time was in high school) where I dropped a class because of something like this.   I've been taking a medication and getting counseling for 3 months now. It's not helping so far. I'm still feeling self-conscious and nervous when I'm doing simple things, like approaching a register or walking down a busy street.

12653,"Panic attack at work... more of a vent - I am just livid.   For months we have been teased with a staff activity later this week where we get the afternoon off to do something fun. I was hoping for a structured sport (like our other office does) or even just something like going to a movie together. It is supposed to be a treat.   Thing is the 19 year old intern was planning it and she apparently didn't think to ask what everyone would be comfortable with... or she just didn't ask me (she never speaks to me or the other employees I know who will refuse to participate). In a group this small I thought she would plan it for the group as a whole, not what she thinks is fun.  Today it was announced we are doing a scavenger hunt through the downtown core in groups of 2-3.... WHY... JUST WHY!?!?  Our office is largely introverted and I suspect I am not the only person that suffers from a social anxiety disorder. I overheard her talking to my coworker (about a manager who 100% will refuse to participate) and she was going on about getting outside of your comfort zone and just getting used to it.   Well if someone forcing me to go on a scavenger hunt will cure my crippling anxiety, I should have just given her the thousands I spent on therapy and ongoing medication!   So as she is going on and on, I am having a panic attack at my desk. At least an hour was lost as I slowly started mentally shutting down and was about to start crying. I lost all track of time but eventually caught myself and went in the bathroom to splash water in my face. My productivity was shit for the rest of the day.   &amp;#x200B;  I get that it is good to get outside your comfort zone... but a forced group activity is bad enough. I have come to learn that I need to be in a structured environment (like the field and job I chose) - so almost anything with structure would have been challenging enough. But this is running around in a group in the busy (and unsafe) downtown core trying to solve riddles and clues. I can't think on the spot and I'll just be running behind whoever I get put with saying ""I don't know"".   I've been on scavenger hunts in the past. Even in a group where I am fully comfortable with everyone around me and sociable, I HATE THEM.   Not even to mention that I am recovering from an injury in my foot (so I shouldn't be running in my work shoes) and I managed to pinch a nerve today in my neck. Add in the forecasted thunder storm for that afternoon (no working umbrella and can't afford a new one)... and you got the most miserable day in existence.   My depression is back and I don't need this in my life right now. I just want to go to work, do my job, and come back home so I can focus on things that make me happy. Not have my afternoon taken away to live this nightmare and go home drained.   &amp;#x200B;  I almost want to try asking my boss if I could be excused tomorrow but it is too hard for me.

12654,"Maybe my comment came off different than I'm intending. I'm not saying to launch a full on attack on the person. And definitely don't go too far if it's someone you don't know. But look at the context here, you simply just don't point out someone in a group and criticize them. There's a way to ask someone if they're ok, and blurting out something about them being too quiet with an entire group of people watching is just not the way. I've been in this situation a million times and not once have i ever felt like it was a genuine concern, it's always critical or some kind of joke. And they'll do it again. They'll bring it up over and over once they get away with it once because it's an easy joke. Saying ""I'm fine and happy when left alone"" is just not the way to respond. I'm sorry. That just leaves you open to more criticism. After like 20 years of this shit the only thing I have ever found that actually stops this from happening is to give them something back. You don't have to use my examples, those just fit my personality and people i hang out with, maybe they're too harsh for other people. If you don't think this method will work for you then don't use it. Different things work for different people. This worked me.

Even if I was shy initially, I was able to open up to others and was the type who gathered a lot of attention because I was talkative and fun to be around. I don’t really know what exactly happened over the years but during middle school I was made fun of a lot and started withdrawing into myself. I have lived my entire life abroad so when I went back to my native place my extended family was really surprised because of how different I was.   I had social anxiety for several years. It was not concisely diagnosed because my parents didn’t believe I needed to see a psychologist, but I always felt like I had it because of how it reflected with me. After entering high school r had gotten a bit better after I got my own group of friends, but ever since the pandemic it’s just gotten so so much worse. Now I just get so scared and my mind goes completely blank when I’m in a social situation. I have no idea what to say, or how to act, or where to look, any of it and it always makes me so nervous.

A few days ago he called my mother and asked her what happened to me that I became so quiet, and he kept asking her what he could talk about with me to make me speak more.

12671,"Intense Feeling of Shame - Hey guys, first time reddit user here. Just some background information: I'm a 25 year old male and I've been struggling with social anxiety ever since I was a kid. I guess I want to vent about this day I had and this overwhelming sense of shame that I'm experiencing. I don't know where else to turn.  &amp;#x200B;  I've just completed 15 weeks of training as a train conductor, which usually involved shadowing another conductor during an average workday. Today was my first day on my own. However, I got put on a job that wasn't covered a whole lot by our training (yard work). I wasn't comfortable with the job and I made this known to the two guys I was working with (I'll be referring to them as Conductor and Engineer). They were indifferent and uninterested in sitting down with me and helping me figure it out. So we set about our job, and it doesn't take too long before I make a mistake. Conductor is immediately irritated.  He starts giving me orders in a tone of voice that makes it very clear that he doesn't think much of me. Naturally my anxiety starts to climb. I start second guessing everything that I do and making silly errors, causing more anger from the crew and more anxiety in me. By the end of the day, Conductor is straight up yelling at me. Engineer won't talk to me at all, but his face tells me everything I need to know about what he's thinking.  I try to level with them, something that has helped me in the past.  I apologize for my performance and ask for some patience as I learn this job. They don't give me an inch. Engineer says something to the tune of, ""Didn't they train you?"". Conductor tells me that they could pull any guy off the street to the job I was doing. ""It's not rocket science"". At this point I feel like the biggest idiot on the planet. I want to crawl into a hole and pull it in after me, but we still have work to do.  I make another mistake while we finish up with the same results, I clock out and walk to my car as fast as I can without standing out.  It's been a few hours since I clocked out, and the whole time I have felt an intense feeling of shame. It won't leave me alone and its about all I can do to keep myself from breaking out into tears. I've tried to distract myself, I've tried to meditate, I've tried just letting myself feel the emotion. No matter what I do  I can't let it go, it's like a stink that I can't seem to wash off. My mind keeps wandering back to the events of the day.  The words said to me play again and again like a broken record. When I go to sleep, I'm willing to bet it's going to follow me into my dreams. I just want to put it past me, but the worst part is that I'll probably have to work with those guys again. The thought fills me with horrible dread.   &amp;#x200B;  Have any of you had similar feelings and experiences? How do you deal with them?

12674,"Should I Take Medication For My Social Anxiety? - To start off, right now I have been dealing with anxiety for about 7 years now.  Currently, I experience bad anxiety from looking at people in the eyes which seems to be family history, we all kind of not look at each other sometimes. I dislike doing presentations because I feel like im constantly being judged with 20+ eyes staring at me. I sometimes avoid simple confrontations with people because I am scared to look them in the eyes and be judged by what I have to say. For example; buying something at a grocery store, catching up with past professors, asking a question in class, things like that.  When talking to people, I usually experience a warm sudden blood rush all throughout my body which is most likely a jolt of adrenaline. This used to result in a bad case of blushing back when I was a child but has gone away since I have changed my diet slightly and started to work out a bit more. Anxiety also affects the way I think and I get scatterbrain right then and there while looking in their eyes. So it becomes difficult to come up with a response without darting my eyes away and thinking about a response. This makes the other person feel awkward and usually snowballs into an awkward conversation.  I have plenty of friends and loving and caring family members fortunately, but yet I can never fully feel comfortable around them when I have to look them in the eyes cause I don't want to feel that adrenaline rush.  Hopefully you guys can help my situation here with ideas for medication, natural remedies, books etc. I absolutely hate going through this feeling everyday and genuinely hope someone out there can help my problem.",reddit,0,0

12691,"Can increased emotions lead to the resurfacing of social anxiety? - When I was around 13, I developed generalised social anxiety and basically did not talk to anyone (except for a few close friends) until I was about 17. During this time, I would dread going to school/going outside etc etc and spent most of my time on the internet, hyper-fixating on various things.   I basically learned how to deal with the anxiety by completely numbing myself to any emotion. After doing this, it was much easier to act normal around people and make friends.  So I began uni this year with the same lack of emotions and I have socially thrived. I have many friends/friendly acquaintances and a very close friend group. However, this is the catch:  Because I was socially thriving this year, I let my guard down entirely in terms of emotions. In addition to that, there was a friend in my group who severely emotionally manipulated us (my friends and I) and it hit me particularly hard. I was the last to defriend her and I had to cut her off entirely, even though up until I cut her off the time I spent with her was still very fun for me (though she was always manipulating me during those times). This has left me very broken and untrusting of myself.  In general, my emotions have skyrocketed and along with it my social anxiety. The restroom in my dorm is across the hall and sometimes I hold in my pee until I absolutely have to go because I dread seeing anyone I know. I feel like people only hang out with me because they pity me. Classic anxiety like that.  Is it possible for there to be a correlation between emotions and social anxiety?

But also I feel like people like reaching out to an idea of me, and get very bored/disappointed by the real thing. When I open up properly they tend to look awkward or dip. I’ve also gotten uglier, and lost my sense of humour. And my sharpness. When I realise all this, i understand why people dip. Then I feel like, okay I need to isolate and improve myself because I can’t see people like this. I’m a drain. And then it’s a vicious cycle. Of somehow disappointing people by both showing and not showing up.",reddit,0,1
12716,"I am here for you if you need it, but first could you read this brain vomit first? - I try to be a good person. I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am.        I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself?      I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am.      I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them?       Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing.    I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence)  and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something.       As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face.  I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment.   For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her.       I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship.      Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end.           Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing.      It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me.  Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me.         I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead?      I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do. ",reddit,1,1

I do have a single best friend that has stuck with me through thick and thin, but it would be nice to have other friends in my life.   In elementary school I was bullied by a lot of people. Not your typical shoved in a locker bullying, but people talked bad about me when they didn’t even know me and I was often excluded. Because of this I just stayed away from people. I was also your typical shy kid so my family always blamed it on me just being shy, I convinced myself that’s what it was. I never understood why people picked on me of all people, I wasn’t weird. I was an average girl. I moved schools multiple times and no matter what I was always picked on.   Eventually I got to high school. My first year I tried starting over and making new friends. I spoke up in class to make myself approachable. No matter what I did people would not talk to me. Anytime I tried to talk to people they would move seats.   I became incredibly closed in the following years in high school. I became miserable.

I'm not sure if I want to post it but I need to vent something (and I have experience that when I something post on net I'm really scared of reaction. Once I post one story I wrote. I thought it was good but then I started feel anxious. This feeling grew up and I started think about how stupid and bad it was so I deleted it)  Now the real reason I decided to write there.  My aunt is going to have a birthday party tomorrow. She invited whole family and some people who she knows. It's sounds like fun but not for me. But her friends (for me strangers) aren't my biggest problem. I will just ignore them and I hope they will ignore me too. My problem is that I'm not able to talk with most of my own family. Always when we visited aunt and uncle I was in my cousins' room and usually stay there for hours (also it was when grandma lives so when I wasn't with cousins I was with here.. *they lived in one big house*) But then granda died and one of cousins got married and the second moved so I had to be with aunt, uncle, mother and her bf (basically my stepfather but I stopped talk with him too.. I don't know when. I don't know how. I don't know why. It has just happened). Now when we visit aunt and uncle (I always try to avoid it) I usually sit in another room and watch TV or do something on phone while everybody talk in other room. I don't want to join into their conversation because their usually talk about people I don't know or about think I don't care about. Sometimes they start smalltalk with me because they want to ask about school or boyfriend(I don't have bf and tbh I don't want anybody. And everybody ask me about relationship and when I'll find someone. It's annoying. When we visit relatives and I'm bored and text with friends they automatically ask on boyfriend. Even if I say I don't have bf and it's only friend they ignore that answer. I really hate this.)  With my brother I have similar problem with communication. Eight/seven years ago he had to moved (because of our mother's boyfriend) so he lived with father. At first I was happy because of sibling's fights but then I just didn't care. He didn't live far away from me and mother but even so we didn't talk very much (greeting when we met and sometimes short conversation what he started. Only per year). When he graduated he was standing in front of our house and was talking with mother about it. When I arrived from school they told me this news. I didn't know what to say (I didn't care tbh) so I only said 'congrats' and went to my room. Last year he found gf and few months ago they moved because of work (circa 6-7 hours traveling by car from there). Once I visited him (to be honest, I was scared what he thinks about me 'cause I twice refused visiting him and my mother wanted me to go too). Our whole conversation was a few sentences. We were alone in house and if he didn't start asking me about school there would be silence. And... When we were talking I was nervous. I wasn't able to talk with him without fast heartbeat. As if I was talking with some stranger. And maybe he is stranger. I realised that I know nothing about him. The rest of this visit I was quiet. I listened them six hours with few sentences I replied when someone asked me on something. But I didn't feel bored(like when I have to visit aunt). I just felt ok when I could listen them and I always was nervous when they were quiet(I was scared that they start asking me).  But I would like to talk with them like normal people again (at least with my brother 'cause aunt said me few things that force me to feel hatred toward her. Toward her and others family members.. And because of my anxiety. I don't think they know about it because I avoid meeting them. But they did some nice things too.) I don't know how to start a conversation with them. I don't know what should I say. I know nothing about them. To be honest brother and his gf arrived two days ago and now they are at father's house. I come there almost every day so I was there when they arrived. But I didn't say welcome or something else. I was in my room and I hoped that they don't come there. And yesterday too. When I came there I sneaked to my room and I was happy because I didn't meet them on hallway. (They saw my shoes in front of my door but they didn't knock on door. I don't know what they think about me, what makes me feel little anxious, but they don't have a need to start conversation with me, neither).  Even if I would be probably glad for tips how to fix this, I'm not sure if I would be able to realise it. I can say to myself 'do this, do that' but do it is sometimes really hard and I just give up and let anxiety win.  Thanks for read this and sorry for my imperfect English.

I'm an extreme homebody and still have the same anxiety because I isolated myself didn't fight it. What your dad said rings true, but I told myself the same things-- I would take a year to work on myself and then go out and be around people, but in my experience that doesn't work. The best time to start working on yourself is while you're in that hell, by showing people you don't care, say fuck them and keep doing your thing.   We aren't the same person, however, and I understand how truly hellish it can feel. But that's what being a kid should be about, learning to deal with it-- I wish I did. Now my demons are so big I can barely leave the house.   All I'm saying is, it's a lot easier to retreat into your shell and ignore other people when you drop off the grid. Look at me--I was going to take a year of self discovery. But it turns out doing school online made me a lot more comfortable in just simply not leaving my house and facing my fears. There's no right or wrong answer, just ask yourself honestly if it's for the best. I'd suggest getting a job/joining hobbies to stay socialized if you do decide to leave school.

However it seems like it's I'm not able to be like this anymore. I feel like I can never be myself around people/my friends, not even around friends I have known for years. I just have a feeling that they won't like me the way I truly am. I noticed it when I say things that affect me personally since they don't seem to really listen/be interested. They usually answer with ""oh haha"" and nothing else and it kinda implements I have to keep the conversation going on my own. And yes sometimes one person is more active during a conversation, but in my case they practically never ask any questions to keep it going. And so I kinda changed when being around my friends and people in general, because I felt I had to be different in order to be socially accepted and liked. I only talked about stuff where I knew the people I was with liked talking about and I talked very little and mostly just encouraged them sharing their problems. It seems in doing so I completely forgot to be myself. And I really don't know how I can be myself again. I pretend to be someone else and I've done it for so long that I don't know who I am. For strangers I can look pretty confident and my smalltalk is good (I think haha), but on the inside I am so insecure. I have no experiences in life in sharing things about me. Things that are really important to me at least. I am so uptight and scared of not being liked, I never share anything anymore..not with friends, nor with my family. And I'm afraid that if someone gets to know me better and actually sees that I'm not the way I was when we met, that they will just turn their back on me and leave.

12737,"Quick rant about being boring - I can’t get past the thought that I’m boring and weird and I can’t fathom why someone would ever want to spend time with me. Like if I happen to be hanging with someone or people the whole time I feel like they just pity me and are keeping me around because they have to. I’ve been seeing a therapist and we’ve talked about how this is my biggest issue. It has translated into me being 20F and never having an intimate relationship with anybody ( SO or even friendships) because why would any want that from me. Part of me is always prepared to be to be rejected so I find a way to reject myself. Anyway sorry for the rant, I’m just feeling lonely and longing to be seen and wanted by someone but while also doing everything possible not to be. Social anxiety is definitely hardest thing I’ve had to deal with , I’m hoping with time an effort I will find a way get passed this.

12740,"Pain from the past - Hi All, I want to get this off my chest as I have been struggling for quite some time.  Growing up I was always different, in terms of looks and personality compared to my siblings - My brother was the outgoing and better looking one.  My parents fussed over him so much, and I always felt neglected, disappointed and that I did not belong.  My father never showed much affection, he has never said he is proud of me or that he loves me which really hurt and it taken me years to accept this and move on.   Now that I am in my late 20's, I look at things differently and try to understand why my parents could not just love me and provide me the nourishment that I required as a sensitive little boy. I see other families and friends who had loving parents and are now successful and it brings me to tears often. I believe early childhood shapes your life and I just wish things could have been different. I am at that point now where I am nourishing my inner child and working on my sub conscious to release the pain and trapped emotions \- Which is actually helping me move forward.  Anxiety has haunted me for as long as I can remember, it is has been a massive journey but I am now finally starting to enjoy life and love myself. There are days where I just wish I could flick a switch and erase all the hurt and pain I went through growing up but other days I accept and appreciate it as I have built up resilience.  Just wondering if there is anyone out there who has been in a similar situation? How did you move on and just live life happily without the past haunting you?",reddit,0,1

I used to be very extroverted and loved attention. My family and I moved from Norway to Sweden for two years before returning. So I started third grade here and wasn't shy at all. Like, I danced multiple times in front of class and the school by myself with no problems. I can't remember where everything went wrong.   So I'm in 12th grade now, with more or less no social life, struggling to to go school, struggling to even talk to my siblings (who are twice my age) and a thriving eating disorder, which I want to say that I have control over, but I don't. Social anxiety and an ed, definitely go hand in hand and just makes everything a hundred times harder.   As I'm writing this, I'm sitting in one of the school bathrooms and bawling my eyes out, because of foreign languages class (which I'm ditching again for the fourth time in three weeks). I've been learning German for like five years now, and Korean for two (self-taught). BUT my classmates act like they are perfect in everything and have this totally fake personality when speaking to others. Also the teacher is pretty strict and doesn't teach well. Everything about German class gives me anxiety. Like, I understand it, but do not dare to speak. I guess this is where my social anxiety kicks in. I have talked to the school and they said that they would not put me under an oral pressure (except from presentations). But you can't learn a language properly without speaking it tho. My anxiety is so bad I'm like cold sweating, rapid heart beat, dizziness and headaches (the ed makes it even worse). I can sit in class and hold back my tears, but it's hard considering we have double classes. So two hours of every class. I don't raise my hand in other classes either.  I'm going to change school after summer vacation. I currently go to what is considered the ""best"" and ""most prestigious"" school in my city and considering how hard it is to get in, I shouldn't complain. Maybe changing to a more ""normal"" school could help relive som of my stress... I go to a psychiatrist, but I don't feel like it's doing anything good. My mom is also aware of this, but she doens't understand it...  Does anyone have tips on how to deal w all of this? I feel very overwhelmed and on the verge of giving up, been that for years now.

Online, it's easy for my personality to come out, though in person it's like I hibernate in a sense.

I get lonely EVERYDAY,wishing I could nuzzle up to someone and have fun together. Unfortunately, I imagine happy moments and realising they probably won't even happen...make me disappointed. It is such a toxic trait but I get jealous when I see couples down the street, holding hands. Unfortunately, I have some kind of anger issues as it is. I just feel like such horrible person who will be in this situation all my life. Well of course I know I got to change things. Ahh I dunno. I guess there's no rush. But in a sense I feel some sort of pressure to get into one. Well I'm just a sheep after all. Though to be fair, I understand why people can't cope without a relationship. They NEED that support and intimacy. But everyone is different and dealing with their own shit in their lives. Another thing is I'm afraid of what my parents would think of my hypothetical boyfriend. I can't really date anyone from a different culture as it brings more problems I guess. My parents don't want me to.  Of course, self development,right?

I was always excluded, made to feel less than, and people used to play jokes on me all the time. In middle school, boys used to make me feel less than but always date my friends. A guy asked me out as a joke once. A guy I liked took advantage of the fact I liked him and did all sorts of messed up things to me because of it.

12771,"Small talk - My (20m) girlfriend (20f) got mad at me because she’s tired of engaging in small talk. I’ve always been socially anxious as well as an introvert so knowing what to say and starting a conversation is hard for me. We’re in a long distance relationship most of the time as well because of college so being far apart doesn’t help. Of course I wish I had things to talk to her about but I genuinely don’t know what’s conversation worthy because the majority of my life, I’ve kept my thoughts to myself.  How do I stop overthinking conversations and so they can flow naturally? I’m okay with keeping conversations going but starting them is a HUGE struggle for me.

12774,"Extrovert x Social Anxiety - Supposed to be an  oxymoron right? To get perspective, Im an outgoing kid. I love to make new friends and spend time with people. With the *right* type of people\*\*   It feels like naturally, I was built to be a very social person. However My insecurities and looping thoughts have been haunting me since I(m20)  middle school. After a long day out with some friends or new people, I reminisce over every single situation or interaction that had occurred. Or at least moments that bother me. Like if I had a very stilted conversation with someone, or an awkward moment of silence when I have nothing to say, even with a friend Ive known for years. Its these little thoughts that GET to me.   Extroverted. with ADD Deppression Anxiety and PTSD.   constantly battling overactive thoughts that sometimes push myself to beg my brain to stop. The other day I had a slight breakdown where I was working, while constantly being bombarded with terrible memories with friends, lovers, strangers, that I dont talk to anymore. And every time a person around my age would walk into the store I could only think of negative thoughts about what that person can think of me. ""Shes pretty, am I appealing enough to talk to her? "" or Comparisons to bigger, more attractive men. these thoughts would circulate my brain until i fall asleep.   However I feel like Im capable of so much more if I had the confidence. Im an outgoing person with some heavy self loathing and anxiety. If I didnt feel like killing myself or anxious solely from the thought of thinking that everyone around me is better than me, or that Im actually an awkward dumb, unaware loser that people pity laugh  at. A forced chuckle or display of kindness when in actuality They think Im just extremely weird.   20 yrs. And Im still trying to find comfort with being myself. Its been a long long journey and I feel like Ive made a lot of progress. My maturity has helped to soothe an overactive mind. Sorry, I feel like my explanations for my thoughts are messy and all over the place. Anxiety and ADD makes a fucking killer combo. Like a combo that makes me want to gouge my eyes out whenever the sinking, pumping, spiking feeling that occurs in my chest that resonates throughout my body that flares out to my limbs, then seeps into my psyche.   Sorry I feel like this post is just a huge rant now, my original intention was to see if I could be able to converse or relate with similair people thats experiencing what Im feeling. I dont want to die man. I dont want to fucking die I just want to feel ok. Im trying to draw out the will inside me to pursue the lost confidence hidden inside me.   I broke down the other day thinking about how old my parents have gotten. And how genuinely excited they are when they visit or when I visit them. These recent years have been really rough and my entire family has been losing it. Ive felt distant and lethargic and wasted years of my life Acting out in order to fill the self degrading thought hole that has developed inside me.   And have you ever had a situation where someone says that I cant talk to them because youre too much? Youre too negative you should stop talking about it so often. OR when you do talk about it and you FEEL like you bring it up too much to your friends and they all think youre annoying.   Another thing that happens to me is that whenever I get a gf, I always get extremely close because if I fall in love with you, or if I feel and acknowledge the love thats being given to me, I become entirely comfortable being myself. Or at least much better compared to just a friend. But then I get too attached because that person is the only person I would feel comfortable with being myself, and since thats the case Ill always go to them whenever I feel like killing myself or having an anxious episode because I dont want to or dont feel capable of going to another person other than them. I try to avoid it. Im trying so hard man, to just exist. To be productive. I feel like I have barely gotten anything done for the last couple years because im too wrapped up in my head. The more soothing thing to do is to do something other than my priorities because the amount of things that I need to overwhelms me and I end up doing nothing. Every single time.   Ive written :   "" transfer photos out of phone"" ""Finish the song youre making"" ""start learning how to edit"" "" develop a certain skill slowly throughout the month or year   These are a few goals that Ive written in my notes a MILLION TIMES   its been years and I stll havent been able to TRANSFER SOME PHOTOS OUT OF MY PHONE and snapchat as well.   What the fuck is wrong with me   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Is what I WOULD think to myself.   I want to conclude this rant saying that Ive proggressed a lot. I was able to reach a point where Ive felt no desire to kill myself during this last winter. It was astounding. I reached a point where Ive never felt so comfortable about myself in my life. Despite me feeling like Ive relapsed back into toxic habits and thoughts, My drive to get better has always stayed with me. sorry if this is a TLDR post. but I really needed to rant in some type of way you know?   to conclude I wanna share some tips; Tips  from an experienced anxious guy   Look up CBT, Learn breathing exercises !! when bad thoughts happen try to imagine that thought drifting past you as a cloud, My anxiety improves whenever I had periods of time that I had a Eureka moment, trying to get my life together by eating right and sleeping better.

12776,"Using ""masks"" to make it easier - First of all, I (20/M) have never been diagnosed with social anxiety or anything, I'm can even be quite a sociable person now. I do however experience a lot of the symptoms of social anxiety.  However, I noticed something during my social interactions : It gets really easier when i'm talking or doing something as ""not only myself"".  As an example, earlier, we were leading a group of kayakers (we're all around the same age) so I was not ""only myself"", but  also one of the people supervising. And it was much easier to talk and do things and being more outgoing because it's kind of like I had a reason to act/talk as I did. But as soon as we were out, I was ""just myself"" again, and then I get much more distant, barely talk or only to people I know well.  Other example: I worked this summer in a hospital. When I was with patients, it was easy to talk because I'm not 'myself' but a member of the staff instead. But when I was with my colleagues, I suddenly barely talk, overthink every single thing and stay apart.  So I was wondering if anyone experiences the same thing or if someone had any advice on how to use this to help me get less socially awkward when i'm ""only myself"".",reddit,1,1

12782,"I feel like everyday of my life is a sex and the city episode, and that im carrie bradshaw learning a new lesson - For many people the scariest thing about driving are incompetent drivers. But today I found out, the scariest thing about driving for me, is being seen as an incompetent driver.   As none of you may now, I'm a very new, very inexperienced driver, who still only his permit. I just got my mom to stop hollering at me every second while driving, and to trust my very shotty judgement when it comes to some things on the road. But today, I felt like all my efforts were dashed.  I had just (fairly safely)  driven my mom to her favorite food chain, panda express. And as I was waiting there in the drivers seat of the car, I decided to pull out my tablet from the backseat and play king of king of fighters, and advanced guardian heroes. This action made me feel like I was very childish, and that everybody was wondering why I, a grown man of 18, was sitting there in the drivers seat.  I let this emotion simmer in me for a while, until it was time for us to leave.  So as I was pulling out of the parking lot, an asian lady and her husband were trying to get into their car, that happened to be parked right next to me. I tried to stop backing up, and ask if she wanted to get into the car first, but this just led to a very confused stare. So then I decided to proceed to back out, a little rattled and embarrassed, but going on strong. As I was backing out, my mom started yelling at me that I was too close to their car (which i don't think I was) and this kinda stayed the vibe for the rest of the car ride   When I got back home, I was despondent. I decided to eat some food, and watch some king of the hill.  In this particular episode of king of the hill, its showed peggy wanting so badly to be seen as a cool person. That she decide to change everything about her that made her her. This made me think that peggy had devalued herself and her abilities as a person. The end of the episode ended with her being friends with the cool mom, because the cool mom was just putting on an act too  I realized that I was scared that other people saw me as a bad driver, And it made me understand that I devalued my self and abilities as a driver. I didn't take into account that I have literally improved so much from the time I first started to learn how to drive.   I exercised a little, read some online articles about the pitfalls of devaluing yourself as a person, and listened to my favorite playlist, and suddenly, I didn't feel so bad about the miniscule situation that happened in the parking lot of a panda express.   Lesson of the day : don't devalue yourself. We're all equal as human beings. And youre emotions and feelings aren't any less than anyone elses. Its okay to not ve perfect. Think about the way you let people treat you, and if you, as a decent person, would treat anyone else like that. Youre enough because you're enough. And that's enough.",reddit,1,1

I'm a college student (F21), and as far as I remember i've always been the shy type of person, introverted and anxious as hell when I had to speak in front of people.  One of my biggest fear was, and still is to end up alone.   Four months ago, I got my degree, and after a lot of work, was accepted in a really great school for my master. I should have been excited and happy, but all I could think about was the fear of not fitting in my new class, not getting along with the other students (we're 21). This college is far away from my town, so I left my family and bf, which was very hard since they're my pillars in life. I told myself I just needed to be myself, and it was ok if I didn't make any friends, but then college started, and as I expected, I felt terrible in this new environement. I managed to speak to few people on the first day, but quickly the shyness took over me, and while they were all starting to be friends and laughing together, I ended up being the quiet loner.  I'm feeling incredibly frustrated and sad, because I pushed myself so much to be social, but there was no results. It just doesn't seem to work, and i'm starting to think my personality really sucks. I know it's not easy to communicate with me, and I get that i'm not really a fun person, but even when I try to be, nothing works.  I get up everyday feeling sick and not wanting to go to college because I know i'll be alone. I know it's just a bad moment to go through, but i'm tired of being the weirdo, tired of having to do so much efforts everyday with no results, tired to see people judging me and thinking i have a problem. ( I do have old scarification/self harm scars all over my arm and shoulder, and it seems to scare people. I can understand.)  Tomorrow, we're all going to a three days integration trip. The idea of spending three days with ""strangers"" is terrifying. They all planned to do different things together, and i'm just there, with nothing to do, and no one to speak to.

Something I've noticed over the last year or so is that I am not at all shy when it comes to talking to people, and occasionally I can go out of my way to and meet and speak to people I've never met before (such as a speed-dating event) and once thrown together with random people I can actually speak to them quite well.  However, the main problem I have is being very averse to putting my foot in the door and agreeing to take part in things that involve meeting new people, and I also have very few contacts outside of my school friends, my work colleagues and my friends from uni. It's not that I feel actively scared of meeting new people, but it might be more of a subconscious thing. As a result, I hardly ever go out unless it's for a purpose or within my comfort zone. I do start worrying about what might happen or what they might think of me. I would describe myself as an introvert who masquerades as an extrovert.

12785,"Working in retail with SA - So for context I’m 24 but got my first ever job just last March. I’ve always been embarrassed about never having a job (I did go to uni - but got kicked out because of low attendance caused by SA and other health issues). I could never bring myself to go to any interviews or couldn’t imagine myself in a work place setting. After all, attending uni was hard enough for me.   After starting my new job, i’ve definitely gained a bit more confidence - I can make some small talk with customers and have found myself transferring this confidence to other parts of my life. My issue is with making friends with work colleagues. They’ve commented on how quiet I am since I started, often pointing out when I raised my voice to get a customers attention. I’m fine with not making lifelong friends there - i’m only there to earn a wage and gain some experience - but I didn’t expect to be so excluded from the work circle. I find myself making effort with colleagues, to talk about even the most rudimentary things, trying to show that i’m not a horrible person who doesn’t want to talk to them. However it’s never reciprocated and actually, some colleagues don’t reply when I say hi to them. There’s even been an instance where my manager has been leaving for a new job, and my colleagues collectively bought gifts and a card, without including me. I didn’t even know this manager was leaving until I seen the gifts in the staff room.   I struggle with small chat that isn’t conversations I can somewhat script in my head, and my head either feels empty or full of anxious thoughts. Other than that, I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong but would say I am nice and polite person at least. I’m aware that being quiet can come across as hostile and uptight to people who aren’t familiar with very shy people, but I didn’t expect this kind of reaction.

Looking back, I'm 24 and I now see how young I was and that with time, things will change if you are persistent.   If you are really worried about weight, try lifting weights or running/skating, something active that you can do regularly and enjoy a little bit. Even walking around the neighborhood for a good half hour is progress and will get your metabolism up. I know how hard it is to cut back on eating, and honestly if you work out consistently for a couple weeks you will start to be able to eat even more food, whatever you want, as long as you keep working out because it will burn off. Especially how fast your metabolism can get going when you are still young.   I was cheated on when I was 16 and I know the ending of a relationship feels like the end of your love life forever when you are your age. Time heals wounds, just don't try to rush the pain away.   I didn't get my license until I was 17, and I thought that was really old, but I know people that didn't start driving until they were even 18-19. I know it sucks not being able to drive, but I'm sure you will be able to afford driver's ed in a reasonable amount of time if you save for it. Do you have any retail or grocery stores near your house that you could walk/take the bus/carpool to? If so, you can get a part time job that you could save up for driver's ed. That will also get you out the house, and get you interacting with people, which sounds scary to people with SA, but after a week or so on the job I think you will come to appreciate it.   Anyways, if you have any questions about anything, you can PM me and I'll try to answer ASAP. Good luck, and don't give up. Conscientiousness is a good trait when you learn to put it to good use, and it's something a lot of people lack.

I don’t know if it’s to the point where it could be Social Anxiety, and I know there’s more accurate ways to get the answer but I want to know what other people think. I don’t remember being this ‘shy’. Maybe I was and I simply ‘don’t remember ‘, but I‘ve found it harder to talk to people I don’t know recently. If my mom asks me to go into a store like Family Dollar , order simply by drive-thru, or if i have to go into any building by myself, I get really nervous and shrink down. I also find it hard asking employees for help when my mom asks me to get help. I dread making phone calls . I get really nervous and have to stop and write down what I want to say . I had my sister tell me that I had to go volunteer with her at our city’s arboretum and I had to beg her to let me not go. I had gone once before to volunteer , messed up, and was afraid of going back. The question bugged me even more when I was forced to go with my mom to work because I had to go to a doctor’s appointment later. Her first job was taking care of an old woman and her husband.

I’ve also been trying to apply for some entry-level fashion logistics jobs (I feel like there’s less human interaction and more physical doing) but they rejected me per usual bcuz of my lack of experience since dog walking is my only on the books job I’ve had so far 😓. I know I want to work with dogs/pet care business as the main goal somewhere down the line bcuz it’s truly my only real passion and I know for damn sure I am not going to sit in an office all day with gossipy co-workers as my social anxiety/introversion just won’t stand for it lol. I swear I’d rather pick up dog shit for a living than ‘collaborate with others’ that’s how bad I am with people and teamwork   I know this is a suggestion you maybe weren’t hoping for or takes a lot of drive n patience but I realize people like us who struggle with SA and are introverts should invest in ways to work for ourselves that way we don’t have to report to a superior or worry about a toxic, people-oriented work environment.

12801,"I recently had a big moment - I don't post very often on Reddit, certainly not here, though I do lurk, occasionally comment, etc etc.  For some background, I’m 23M, fairly successful, and besides anxiety, I like to think I have a good head on my shoulders. College was a time of major change for my anxiety. I went from the worst year of my life (freshman year) due to anxiety, to a guy with a job straight out of graduating. Socially, I am much more able and confident now than where I was 5 years ago (I have made and can make friends, go out, have a fun time - all within a reasonable comfort zone)  But even now, I still have a great anxiety around romance. I’m afraid of dying alone, dying a virgin (and I know that it's a dumb thing to be scared of, I wish it was that easy to not be afraid).  After months and months (not counting during college) of dating apps, 'okay' first dates that lead nowhere, a sudden change in outlook, I hit a pretty major milestone.  After coming back to my place, the girl I had been hanging out with for the day kissed me. We kissed a bunch more, went up to my apartment, cuddled and kissed some more.  I gotta tell you, I loved it. I was pushed outside my familiar comfort zone into uncharted territory, and in a way, I just went with it.  I got the sense we would have been able to go past first base, but that was beyond this new territory - I was enjoying the cuddling too much to go further tbh. Having that time to learn signals from the other person, to actually feel comfortable with myself physically is just what I think I needed. Deep down, those lies I tell myself aren't true. I *am* worthy, I *am* capable, I *am* a handsome boy after all.  I needed to get that out there. Maybe it'll give someone hope.  I’m excited for the next step.

I still miss my ex and sometimes loneliness takes over me and makes me feel like crap. So if the relationship goes wrong at the end, you'll still feel sad. So it's a good thing, but it's not as awesome as one may think. And third, if it makes you upset, work towards getting one. Get to meet new people. Attend social gatherings with them. Try new things.

Recently, I've developed really negative views of other women my age. I never felt this way before, but a slew of recent experiences has left me feeling really jaded about the women in my life.   First, they seem to be pretty heavily invested in social media. I've met guys who also snapchat regularly, but not to the extent most women do. I, on the other hand, don't really find social media adds anything to my social life, so I don't use it.   Second (this goes hand in hand with the first), they seem to be fairly narcissistic. Every conversation requires endless compliments about physical appearances. I don't find makeup and getting dolled up very interesting, but this seems to be what most average women are interested in.   Third, many of them are quite shallow and disingenuous. For instance, I can't count the number of times a woman has told me she'd *love* to hang out and when I try to initiate, they're always busy. They also don't tend to be looking for a deeper, emotional bond with someone but rather a fellow cutie to act as a wingwoman or a funny sidekick to make an evening more fun. When shit hits the fan, they are simply not there for you.   A lot of you may say that I should find women with similar interests, but I have, and they tend to be homebodies and not really interested in spending meaningful amounts of time with me. They also tend not to be very interested in trying something new or adventurous.

12832,"I’m embarrassed about going to school. Please any advice or comments. - Hi, I’m a boy going into grade 8 this year. Last year at the end of the school year i had something very embarrassing happen to me and having problems dealing with it.   It happened at recess last year in grade 7. Some of my friends were tossing the football around near the football field at school. I wanted to go play too and they said i could play with them and tossed the ball around.  i lost interest after 5 minutes and then started to walk away. There was about 15 kids around in the area near the football field. After walking away i heard laughing near the football field and got my attention.   I turned around and saw some guys dragging this one kid by is legs and i saw he was starting to lose his sweatpants he was wearing and could see his underwear. i also then saw another kid get dragged to the football goal post and put his legs inbetween both posts. i was curious and stood there watching this all happen.   After seeing that happen i remember turning around and facing the school. Then the worst thing happened! All of a sudden i felt my sweatpants i was wearing get pulled down to my ankles. I remember standing there and was wearing y-front blue Hanes briefs. I pulled my sweatpants back up and felt my face turn red. I turn around and see both of my friends that i was throwing the football with. They were standing side by side laughing at me and i took off chasing them around the football field trying to catch one of them. But they were too fast for me.  I just remember feeling so embarrassed and wondering how many kids at recess saw me.  I felt like i was in a daze and when recess was over i went back to class and told my teacher.  Then after school i told my Mom. I just was so embarrassed and wondered why they wanted to do that to me. I didn’t even want to go to school the for awhile because i thought maybe some guys or girls that saw what happened would tell other kids what happened and point at me. or they would laugh at me because i wore briefs and not boxer briefs like cooler guys.   I just don’t know what to do? Help me.  Anyone that reads this please tell me what you think of this situation and how to deal with this. Sometimes i feel like i want revenge on my 2 friends and embarrass them.   Please more advice and more comments the better. Need help from this anxiety. Thanks!",reddit,0,0
12833,"SAD or just shy? - I've just recently been reading about SAD, and I suspect it has significantly impacted the last 15 years of my life. But I've read articles about how shyness and SAD are different. How do I know? A few things about me:  - I have several friends that I can talk to comfortably - I've always known I was ""shy,"" but I assumed I'd ""get better"" one day. This was 15+ years ago. - I consistently avoid social situations involving meeting new people. - I don't date. Meeting someone seems impossible for me. Talking to strangers makes me turn red, start sweating, and I freeze up when trying to progress any conversation. - My interactions with people who aren't my friends - even people I work with every day - are very uncomfortable and I can't seem to open up whatsoever. - I want to be able to socialize ""normally,"" but I haven't been able to do it. It's like a complete mental block goes up when an opportunity to socialize arises, and I end up avoiding it entirely.  Any help would be appreciated. I've always been described as shy, but it just feels like so much more than that when reflecting on the decisions I've made and how different I am socially than everyone else.",reddit,0,0
12834,"I missed the second day of my new job due to extreme SA. - And I'm too scared to call in to say something and apologize. I might already be fired at this point.  This post turned out to be longer than I thought it would be... I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through, that means a lot!  I'm 23 (FtM) and I've had horrible SA my entire life. I was a loner all throughout my school years and only ever had a couple good friends during that time. I would always eat lunch alone in a secluded spot, I failed 2 classes in high school because I was too embarrassed to talk and participate. I also missed out on both prom &amp; homecoming because I didn't really have anyone to ask to go with me, and probably would not have asked them even if I did.   I spend all my time either sleeping or on the computer / playing video games, to try to distract from my reality or escape to a different one. As a result I'm very tech savvy, but that hasn't proven to be too useful outside of my hobbies.  Anyway, my SA has grown to become severely debilitating. I previously had a job in retail, where they started me off as a cashier. After 2 embarrassing panic attacks I was able to find a little relief when they moved me to the back in their warehouse. But there were people back there, too. I felt so out of place and loathed having to interact with my coworkers back there. There were many times where I called off sick (well, texted...) because my anxiety made me physically ill. They were very patient and understanding, but I still felt guilty that I couldn't just be normal like the other people working there. That job ended when I had a mental breakdown / existential crisis and stopped going to work altogether.  I survived on unemployment for 7 months, until recently when my account was compromised and I realized I would have to call somebody to help me regain access. I'm still trying to work up the courage, because the other option is working a job.  I did manage to land myself a job very recently (the one mentioned in the title) at a quick service restaurant, as a crew member / cashier. I was freaking out over the interview, but somehow managed to sell myself well enough that they hired me right after. I used phrases like ""calm under pressure"", ""very laid back"", and ""I handle stressful situations well"". Most of the time, none of that is true. But I sure as hell wasn't going to admit that I'm an awkward nervous wreck that shits themselves when a person approaches me at the register. I basically described myself as an entirely different person lol.  Yesterday, they had me come in to watch several hours of training videos, then they fed me and sent me home. Kind of a cheat day, really. It still took a lot of convincing for me to show up for that, though. One module of the training videos, however, noted that if you're sick and experiencing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. do not even try to come in, because that could be a big health violation for the restaurant. So of course, I end up using this to justify why I can not come in today.   Last night in the middle of the night I wake up to pee and as I'm trying to get back to sleep, the anxiety creeps into my mind again and won't stfu. It progresses and soon I'm sitting there with my stomach in knots, and I eventually begin experiencing vomiting and diarrhea. A few hours pass and it's time to get up and get ready to go. But the anxiety has not subsided, so neither have my symptoms. I tell myself that they'll get mad if I show up puking and pissing out my ass, so I might as well shower and climb back into bed. And that's what I did. I'm STILL feeling sick though, despite that. I could not bring myself to call in to work and explain what happened, out of fear of being fired immediately. As a result of being a no call on my second day, I'll probably be fired immediately anyway.  What do I even do at this point?? If I don't have SOME source of income, I'll end up homeless. AGAIN. I think I'd rather die. There's got to be something I can do. Maybe some kind of work that doesn't involve people. Maybe something remote. Maybe something with computers. Maybe a combination of all three? Or could I qualify for disability if my anxiety is this debilitating? Does anyone have experience with that?  Please guys, I need some ideas and advice. Anxiety has taken over my life and it's threatening to destroy it.",reddit,1,1
12835,"Yes it will be terrible so get help early and don't wait until you're like 20 like I did. Luckily I had a few short periods of fun so I don't feel like I totally missed out, but for the most part I didn't enjoy college and my early 20s at fucking all. Worst years of my life for sure since it's all about being independent and social which I did not do at all since I was so frozen from my anxiety, figuratively and literally.   As far as keeping down a job, you'll definitely be able to keep down a job that doesn't require a ton of social interaction. Depending on how gritty you are, you might be able to stick with a job that does require more social interaction long enough to improve.

12836,"I'm a 24 year old male, and I used to have extreme social anxiety,. I had similar thoughts to you, and thought of myself as a ""boring"" person, and part of the belief stemmed from the fact that I didn't do much other than stay at home and wank. However, I worked my ass of on my social anxiety using cognitive behavioural techniques and now can socialize with pretty much anyone, and I lost my virginity as well this year, and now have fucked five women, and find it fairly easy to talk to woman.  You have to understand that you're a proccess, not some static ""thing."" If you believe that your'e a ""static"" thing that is either good or bad, interesting or uninteresting, you won't work on changing and thus inevitably you won't change. Also, you'll ignore your positive and interesting attributes and solely focus on the poor one's which according to your black and white thinking, make you a totally boring and uniniteresting person.  What I suggest you do is force yourself to socialize with people despite your insecurity, approach women you find attractive, go out and try new experiences.

12837,I had that same feeling when I first started driving. I got my permit at 15 and a half when I could first get it. I was so excited at first but was so scared I didn’t start driving until a year later.  I found the best thing to do was to just do it and practice going short distances with the nicer parent.

I plan on telling my parents when they come home in hopes that theyll let me go to the doctors and get me diagnosed/medicated.  Its gotten so severe that I cant even talk to my friends anymore without having a panic attack which has resulted in me simply remaining silent when around them. (I generally dont even hangout with anyone anymore.) Last year I lost 3 fairly close friends because no matter what i tried I couldn't say a single word for 3 hours. That experience devastated me and is honestly the worst thing that ever happened too me. This year I was able to treat it recreationally with marijuana although, I was caught and due to my parents thoughts on marijuana I don't think its a viable option anymore. Its sad to see my anxiety coming back after about a year of it being gone.  What Im wondering is how long does it take to get a prescription for anxiety on average? Does the medication work? My moms been on zoloft for a very long time because she has anxiety as well so Im hoping that will increase my chances of being treated.

I live at home with my parents and feel like I will never be able to leave out of this chapter in life, especially since I struggle with social anxiety and being on the autism spectrum.   Over the past year, I have applied to numerous jobs mostly relating to things for my degree, including entry level ones that don't pay too much, but I either get no response or they say they moved on with other people. I am pretty limited in where I can work as I am unable to drive due to a disability and I live in an area that is pretty far out from everything with public transportation being pretty much non-existent here so you need to be able to drive to get anywhere, much less places where the jobs are. Of course since I have no job, I can't move to a more accessible area.   I feel like I hurt myself career-wise due to my social anxiety as I never had any kind of real job before, which I feel like it's embarrasing for someone my age. The only money I've made was by reselling things but ever since covid last year that got much harder. I also have pretty much no networking with others in the field or anything, possibly making it that much more unlikely for people to hire or even consider me. I feel like I went to school for nothing sometimes and that my skills are useless. I am using an anonymous account so if anyone wants to ask questions about this stuff or chat in detail, PM me.   I don't know what to do anymore. It's really frustrating because I want to get out there on my and live on my own, make more money, plus I have student loans to pay. Makes things more annoying when every now and then my parents would ask me if I've been applying to any jobs and why have I not gotten a job yet? even though I have been applying to numerous jobs and nothing came of it apart from 3 interviews. Plus it's just too chaotic living here with my parents and younger siblings. My Parents sometimes treat me as if I'm 13 years old and constantly complain and yell about every little thing in the world. My younger siblings also get pretty annoying and immature at times that I stay alone in my room (which my parents get mad about me doing that too). It's not like I don't help around the house either, I cook dinner on days that my parents can't do it, clean up after myself, help if needed around the house, so on. But it's like nothing satisfies them. I have anger issues too that honestly may have even been caused by my parents. Sometimes I feel like the only way I'd be out of this situation is if I died. I am home all day long because I have nowhere to go, I have no friends in person to visit, just friends I met in online communities.

12853,"Likewise, I haven't used social media  'properly' since I was in high school (22 now, finished school at 16). I  rarely check Facebook (although I use Messenger a lot for the sake of  keeping in touch with people) and other than Reddit, I just don't do  social media at all anymore. I personally believe it was more due to me  feeling like I had nothing worthwhile to share, which in turn made me  feel even more insecure because everyone-else was hitting life's  milestones (graduating college/uni, getting into relationships, having  kids, going on holidays, etc).  But then I realised that social media is mostly used as a way for people to show off (not in a vain way, but as is human nature, people want to celebrate and share in their accomplishments), and it made me realise I was only making myself feel worse by comparing my full story to their highlight reel. So I stopped using it.  Fast forward to now where I actually have my first job and I'm starting a Games Design HND next month, and I might feel like I have something worth sharing again. But for the moment, I just use Reddit and Instagram - not for myself (uploading photos will take a lot more confidence haha), but I like having somewhere to post my art so I can see it all on one page. And, who am I kidding, it makes me feel good if even one or two people happen to like it.  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR; The effect of social media depends entirely on the situation of the person using it.

I think I gained it back bc I switched my ADHD meds(the ones I used to take suppressed my appetite), I no longer play volleyball like I did in high school, and lastly I gained the college 15 after only one semester.  Well I dropped outta college and rn I’ve just been trying to get better mentally before I jump back into anything. I’ve been very bored at home feeling like I’m not doing anything of value, so I was thinking maybe I’ll start going to the gym and work towards a goal. By going to the gym not only would it help me lose weight but it would also give me something to occupy my time and work towards a goal, ntm exercise will help my mental health.  The issue is the thought of going to a gym gives me so much anxiety. Ik for a fact I’ll see someone ik there(even if it’s just an acquaintance), and I’ll get all self conscious and want to leave. Aside from that though I have pretty bad hyperhydrosis that isn’t in a localized area so my whole body/clothes get drenched in sweat even if the workout isn’t hard, maybe if I was thinner I’d be slightly less embarrassed of it but bc I’m kinda chubby ik people are gonna think I’m sweating bc I’m a fat ass. The sweating will also get all over whatever I’m using so I’ll have to awkwardly wipe it up post workout.

12862,"I’m terrified (please give me advice or success stories) - Hey all, so I’m 18 and am a senior in high school. For my whole life I’ve dealt with social anxiety disorder as well as generalized anxiety disorder. These affect my daily life pretty badly but I’m usually able to keep my head above water and get through the school day despite being completely exhausted. I go to a small private school and luckily have been able to take advantage of some of their mental health outlets (such as a calming room, in school therapist appointments,etc.). Although these things exist for me and I have a few places to go if I’m really struggling, I’ve been petrified of going to school. Today was the first day back from winter break and I couldn’t even muster up the courage to go. I was so stressed out that i didn’t sleep at all last night. The reasons I’ve been terrified to go to are as follows: 1. Before winter break I had an important presentation that went terribly. I stuttered, shook, and could not get through the presentation very well. This set off a string of anxiety and panic attacks the rest of the day. Because I was struggling so bad I went to the calming room, but as soon as I stepped out of the room an hour later, I had more panic attacks. It got so bad I thought I was going to pass out so I ended up running into the nearest classroom to ask for help. The crowded hallways affected me so severely.  2. Following this, during winter break I could not even go into a store. I love shopping, but I couldn’t step foot in a store without having a panic attack. How was I supposed to spend 8 hours at school when I couldn’t even spend 20 minutes in a store?  3. My panic attacks make me feel like I’m dying or having a medical emergency and I don’t feel comfortable at school  4. I’ve lost all motivation and can’t even focus on work. I failed two of my exams because I was so anxious I couldn’t understand what the questions were asking   I couldn’t sleep last night because I was pondering on these things. I don’t take any meds (which may change soon) and my counselor is planning to meet with me when I return to school to create a plan to help me feel more comfortable at school.  I’m very frustrated because I feel pathetic and weak. It’s hard for me to talk about this with people I’m close with, such as my long term boyfriend and best friend because they’re extroverted and confident in social situations. They don’t really understand, though they try to, but I just feel as if I come across as stupid. This is severely affecting my life and I feel trapped, even to the point where I wish I could just disappear. I just want the old me back. Even though I’m usually anxious 24/7, I miss when I could go to school without having a panic attack.  My physical symptoms are the worst thing and they make me panic more, them being: - shaking and feeling weak  -dissociation  -dizziness and faintness  - stomach ache or IBS - strongggg fatigue ‼️ - confusion or lack of focus  - shortness of breath  - heart palpitations  Please give me any tips you have that you think would help me.

He told me “if u have social anxiety and u don’t take medication for it u don’t really have social anxiety”. He then started to tell me that everyone that has social anxiety should get checked up for autism. He said there is some very mild autism’s that is hard to see. But all I have read up on, says it’s normally discovered in middle school at latest. I think I asked my current therapist this before and he just laughed and said “you don’t have any personality disorders or autism”. But I just keep doubting myself. I don’t fit with like a lot of the autism symptoms I don’t think! But it’s always that “what if”.  I’m scared :/",reddit,1,1

When I was at a party a girl who was a few drinks in came up to me and said ""get your ugly ass out of here"" and her friends straight up just laughed and agreed, needless to say I have never been to a party since and that really blew a hole in me. As a result of these moments occurring over the years; I avoid people like the plague purely because I'm afraid of what they will say or do. Why should they even interact with a downright weirdo. I don't look at people in the eyes or smile because I think I'm staring into their soul and that I look creepy when I smile. I don't know what the fuck to do, I just look like an angry ugly MFer that no one would even go near and it's really been taking a toll on my mental health, it really sucks man. I wish I could converse with a friend, A SINGLE FRIEND. As a 21/M, how the hell am I even going to get a job and function in this social driven society.

And no, I don't think I am shy, I just can say hi as well perfectly, but it's really boring for her and for me either.

He graduated HS but lied about going to college to go to the library to play League of Legends. My mother kicked him out at 18 because he wasn't doing anything so he ran away for a week and took a train to Toronto from BC. When he came back he stayed at my fathers. He worked at McDonalds but got fired because when the burgers need restocking the cooker would need to yell to get more from the freezer and he would never do that even when its busy as hell. He would just freeze and not talk. My dad got him a job at the McD's close to where he lives and on the first day he ran away again without saying nothing to Calgary with nothing but his phone and it was -40C. My dad did not force him to get a job or was aggressive which makes it so confusing.  He came back a week later and moved in with me and my mom and I promised to get him better. At home he says the bare minimum and now it has gotten to the point where he doesn't even say anything unless he gets yelled at which makes him snap back in return. He does not think anything is wrong with him. I tried to relate to him today, telling him I went through the same thing and tried to commit suicide and when I was about to tear up he laughed at me and said ""I'm not gonna kill myself are you stupid, leave me alone"". I am literally in tears because he believes its normal to play the computer all day and just eat and sleep. We are going to the doctor to get a psychiatrist referral because a week before he did open up to the family doctor when I told him I have AvPD and SAD and he told the doctor he thinks he has it as well. He is living off his savings and im just waiting for it to run out. I offered him a job and car and he was gonna take it but I got mad at him for not responding to my texts so now he doesn't want it.

You deserve all of the happiness that we see everyone else seem to have.    I recently started therapy and have very similar thoughts when I talk to her.  I'm ashamed that I think what I think about my self.  About life.  About all of it.  I've felt this pain for nearly 20 years.  I could continue burying it and hoping things change or I can be open and try to receive help.  Yeah, it may be straight up humiliating sometimes to say what I really feel.  I'm embarrassed when I cry in front of her.  I feel worthless.  I feel hopeless.  But at the end of the day, she deals with people like me all the time.  Some worse off, some better off.  It's just what it is.  If I hide from my thoughts and feelings then I'm going to be battling those same demons tomorrow and the next day.    The chances of me seeing her in the real world are slim so I don't give a shit how she views me or how horrible I feel when I express myself to her.  She's there to take all of that and help me.  There's no help in shutting down or being afraid.   I've started using the phrase ""pull the band-aid off"" in my life.  It means that sometimes I have to take that extra bit of pain to get what I need.  It sucks some time.  Actually, a lot of times.  But, I've found that it helps me when I need that extra motivation to take care of myself.  I have no support system.  No friends.  So that extra kick is often in a direction that leads to help.  It may not be what I hope for, but it's better than I can do myself.  Maybe the way I look at therapy would be a good way to think about calling that hotline.  I know that it's not easy.  It's painful.   It's embarrassing.  It's humiliating.  It's a lot of things, but that pain can lead to tremendous growth.",reddit,0,0

I have felt like I'm drowning in a black abyss and nobody around me seems to notice. I have felt so alone lost in my own head and easily became depressed about life and having no direction.  So I know this advice may not take easily, but just know it comes from someone who's been in that exact spot.   You gotta focus on something to get your life moving forward. For me grades and school work I always used as something to put energy in. Cause I had a tiny tiny tiny hope to cling to that I could go to college and become better and make money and pull myself out of bad situations. And now I'm 24 and did all the things I pushed myself to do.   You gotta change how you think about stuff. You don't have to super social to be happy. You don't have to make a lot of friends in college to be happy. There is nothing wrong/bad/incorrect with being solo. Start thinking about these things and try and find a life goal to work towards. Find that tiny tiny tiny bit of hope.   And this sounds like bullshit, but with time you won't be in the same life situation anymore. Things change ( sometimes slowly), but I'm NOTHING like I was at 17. You WILL change. For the better.  Depression and anxiety are still with me but you develop skills and they don't affect me as much or in the same ways.   So please don't hurt yourself. I had those thoughts before.

I was trying to figure out why everyone acted older, smarter, more confident than me, snd I realized that my social skills and life skills were way behind everyone else's, and that I was very immature for my age, from the way I talked to people to the way I felt and dealt with anything.  I went out on a limb to try to catch up and started smoking at church and hanging out at church with a couple rebellious kids (who were younger than me by the way). I begged my mom to move back to civilization so we moved back into town and I went to a different high school, as an 18 year old (we had an extra optional year back then). I hung out with the smokers because I didn't know anyone else, but I hated them all because all of them were very unfriendly and even hated each other, so I never really made friends with anyone there. Once I graduated I never heard from anyone ever again.   I had a job at a coffee place which helped a bit with socializing. I then went to college in Toronto just to try establishing myself somewhere new and somewhere with over 2 million people. I lived with a pastor family who treated their adopted 17 year old son like he was 7 and were very rude to him. I couldn't make friends in Toronto and I hated my program so I dropped out and moved back home, first with m mom and then with dad. I then tried the local college, I graduated barely but barely hung out with anyone and I began drinking a lot of my grandpa's and dad's beer and wine.  I moved back to my mother's again because she had to have a couple surgeries and my brothers disabilities were getting worse. She was also extremely abusive towards me and my brothers during this phase, and during this period I got so stressed out due to all of my own problems combined with my family's problems that i burnt out, and all that motivation and energy and hope I once had completely disappeared, and i haven't been the same since then.  I then went to a bible college, I didn't live on campus my first year since I lived with my psychotic family, but since I felt left out and couldn't take my family anymore I moved on campus.  Same story. It was nice being around mostly friendly people, and I did get into a group of friends, but I had a really hard time connecting with them still, and they all moved overseas a couple years later. After graduating I lived with a guy from campus who is more socially awkward and immature than I ever was, but I had no choice.

Instead of trying to hide and repress my feelings with drugs, I got clean and learned how to allow myself to actually feel. I learned that I am lesbian. I learned that I want nothing more than love and friendship in my life. But now that I opened Pandorica's Box I can't stop the flood of feelings. It's all negative though, nothing positive at all. I suppose that's what I was always afraid of and the reason why I got addicted in the first place.  With the help of my therapist I was able to visit a social group for the first time in my life. It's a LGBT group because I wanted to meet people like me. And even though I keep visiting (once or twice a month) I still haven't managed to build any contact to the others. I'm always sitting there hoping to find somebody I can have a little chat with, but in the end I just go home having spoken to no one.  I'm in a constant state of worry. I worry about my appearance, I worry about my financial situation, I worry about the future, I worry about finding friends. And if I can't even find friends how the hell am I supposed to ever find love? More than anything in the world I want to know what it feels like be loved.  I am making this post because I don't know what else to do. Being at home in my little dirty room literally all the time is killing me. I don't have a job and the only social contact I have is this group, but I need more than that. What else can I do? There is nothing that interests me, no hobbies. I need a few good ideas and inspirations about what else I could try, I need a place where I can go to practice being social without any kind of pressure, but every time I try I get overwhelmed by worries about how bad I look and how lonely and desperate I am to make friends.  I don't know if you can help me in any way, but I'd appreciate it if you tried. ",reddit,0,0

12908,"It looks like I am giving up because of my social anxiety again - The words of my ex-friend  “You are a coward. You always run away from conflict instead of facing it. Stop doing that shit.”  Yet, here I am going to do it again. I am a 23F. I have 107 followers on my Twitch account, that wasn’t intentional. After posting on Reddit about me starting a live stream despite my social anxiety and meeting a new friend, people asked for my username. I didn't like to leave questions unanswered so I was gullible enough to say then post my username on my profile so people won't continue to ask. I wasn't expecting many people to follow me.   I was hoping to build a following naturally by people knowing and liking what I say or do but having multiple people follow me without knowing who I am, not seeing my content, or hearing me. It’s anxiety increasing. The reason why I started the stream was to practice talking without feeling embarrassed in front of one or two strangers. Now I have an audience and feel the tension to entertain.   The thought of them regretting their decision to follow me after knowing me. This is very stressful. The longer I avoid live streaming because of my anxiety, the more I think about deleting my account and disappearing. I do make irrational decisions when afraid and stressed. I don't want it to come to that, I don't like disappointing others.  My social anxiety is that bad, I can't voice call or live stream without being dead silent or very awkward. I would need another person to keep talking for me to talk more.  I never had a voice of my own. People put words in my mouth, saying what I want, think, or feel since I was younger. I have been told to shut up, laughed at, yelled at for talking, I have no opinions anymore. I fear people's reactions and judgment towards me. It feels like being myself isn't an option, more like a crime, and I will be punished for committing it.   To my followers, if they read this, probably not. I am sorry if this post offends you, you are all good people, and thank you for the support.  If I do decide to delete my accounts, I am sorry again.",reddit,1,1
12909,"I'm about to turn 23 next month. And I don't see any change in my life. - I'm 22 and had received my associates degree back in the summer. I should be happy, right? But I know a piece of paper isn't a true acheivement. I wanted to start bachelors classes but I'm completely unmotivated because I feel I'll be terrible in whatever field I chase. Having a career isn't the only worry I have, this just adds to the weight I carry from being so lonely.  I really struggle with self-perception. I HATE how I look and am positive it's been a factor as to why people don't seem to like me. I work a job where people talk to each other but never me. People constantly have friends and girlfriends and hookups, yet these are the same people who treat others like shit, including me. I don't understand why I get treated so badly and isolated from the rest. I recently went to a trip with some managers, and I felt like I didn't fit in AT ALL. I'm so quiet wherever I'm at, meanwhile other people get approached with ease. I was made to feel weird.  I don't even have a friend to talk to. Everyone has people texting them on phone or snapchat. People in real life hate me so the Internet is the only platform I have to turn to. I try my hardest to get some real answers as to why I'm so lonely but I barely get any responses.  Why is it that I don't deserve anyone to talk to? Why is it that others can do as they please yet me being quiet and keeping to myself get the most hate from others? It's SO FUCKING hard to deal with feeling like this. Why is that so inconceivable?  Has anyone here found any degree of success with finding someone? There's no point in being alive if you're friendless. I just work, eat, and sleep. Up until recently I was doing my best to go to the gym. But the lack of friendship and the way people are around me ruined my motivation. I don't have friends. Co workers don't like me. I've still never had sex. I've realized that people love to walk over shy, quiet people like me. Everyone in this sub is hated by the rest of society. I don't think anything can change, at least not for me. I'm almost 23 and socially dysfunctional. And I don't want to try anymore. Everyone preemptively has something against me.",reddit,1,1

This is not the case when I am around my very good friends, whom I feel very comfortable around and keep me calm. I found it most common in bars and other loud places. At first I just thought it was the alcohol causing the heartburn, which isn't unreasonable. It finally hit me when I was pretty drunk with friends and we transitioned to the bar. I noticed my esophagus begin to feel uncomfortable like heart burn. I went home, drank some water and smoked  and it immediately went away once I was in my quiet place.

12916,"Sheltered childhood (M20), left home last year to a new city and feel like a man-child - First post on Reddit so please bear with me  So...I have been sheltered and coddled my whole childhood by parents with good intentions and a horrible understanding of the possible outcomes.   First of all, a bit of backstory. My parents marriage is fairly dysfunctional (mom has huge emotional baggage but also is effectively taking care of my dad emotionally - he’s even worse). This has led to a pretty unstable home where everyone was always walking on eggshells and “only positive emotions were acceptable”. I never rebelled against this and always stayed the “good kid”, which was great for keeping our dysfunctional family dynamic together but horrible for making friends or developing a shred of confidence or self respect.   I love my parents and I understand now that they were both doing what they thought was right at the time (even though resentment towards them pops up every now and then, which I’m trying to improve).  Unfortunately, because of always acting like the “nice little kid” and never experiencing people dislike me or get mad at me (openly at least - can’t say whether or not that was different behind my back), I now feel like this underdeveloped child in a young mans body. Hell, even the 15 yo kid I work with is more emotionally stable and confident than I am.  I am so scared of conflict, people judging me, and people thinking I’m a bad person that I feel like there’s this whole side of myself that is completely undeveloped, making me feel like an immature, pathetic little kid even though I’m “technically” an adult.  I have been working with my therapist to gain more self-compassion (i.e. stop thinking of myself as an “immature pathetic little kid”) but I guess what I’m really hoping for is advice on how to deal with pushing past being over sensitive and learning how to develop my rough side and stand up for myself. Also, the constant pain of embarrassing myself by panicking under the smallest of issues when the teenagers I’m working with are relaxed is almost unbearable at times.  If anyone has ANY advice, personal stories, or questions please feel free to respond.  Thank you very much for listening and for any input you might have! :)",reddit,0,1

Because I'm not comfortable with my look. I don't feel beautiful. I don't know how to flirt. But there was someone online who changed my ways a bit. We were like bestfriends. Our foundation of friendship became really solid. He knows everything about me and he didn't run. He inspired me to do better. I didn't want to buy clothes before because I didn't wanna get criticized or nothing will look good on me. After I met this guy, I became a little bit more confident, buying more clothes for myself, having more voice for myself. It's all because of him. I owe it to him. But sadly, we broke up online and fell into depression not because he left me. But that's another story.  I'm telling you this because online dating is not all bad. Always think that there is always someone out there who will listen and help you with your issues. Just don't give up looking for that person. There will always be that someone.

And also to just put my all over the place mind to something orderly. I had social anxiety for like 3,5 years. It all started when I moved to a new city and a new school. Before that I was extroverted I suppose, I was pretty cool kid. I felt confident, school was boring but my and my friends were making jokes so it was more tolerable. I remember thinking 'Everyone can be friends with anybody if they just see each other often' But boy was I wrong...  I Went to one school for 4 months but the education there was poor so I moved to another. I stayed there 1,5 year and then I moved to another where I'm in now. Idfk what the fuck is not right with me...  I've been searching for answers for about a year now I guess... I don't wanna be a victim I want to fucking dominate, be a cut throat motherfucker, but instead I barely utter a damm word. What the fuck? What are people thinking of me? I guess they think I'm a fucking loser.  Let my explain my experience with SAD I talk to a person. (I usually can ask questions n shit and overall cary the conversation) While we speaking I don't enjoy myself, I feel like if they wanted to insult me I would take it like a bitch. I would just laugh awkwardly and that's it.  After we go our ways, I hope to never see that person again because I'm convinced they hate me!

I love my family, and no matter how horrible and empty I feel I vowed never to do that to them. In fact I don’t even let my pain show. The crying for hours, binge drinking (aka right now), the cutting. I especially would never put my little brother through that. The last time I let it show was age 14 when I accidentally cut too deep after a traumatic experience and needed to go to the hospital. My mom picked me up and my family never talked about it again.   I’m almost 20 now. It’s never gotten better it seems. And lately I’m getting so tired. It’s getting more and more difficult each day. I don’t have any friends because of my anxiety, yet I’ve allowed myself to date a string of awful boys for the past few years. I don’t fit into cliques of girls and most guys just try to hook up or date (it seems) I live in an extremely hick, small town. I use to read and write and I use to model but I don’t do anything anymore. Recently I deleted all of my social media, and I got rid of most of my belongings.

It doesn’t matter how much I fight it, it’s still going to be here. Realizing and accepting that as a fact has allowed me to get out of the way. It doesn’t matter what I think, it’s just a part of me as much as my hand or foot.  It’s not a good or bad thing. I never chose to be this way. It’s not my fault I feel this way. Obviously if I had a button to push and change it then I would in a heartbeat. There’s no reason to beat myself up for it. It’s not my fault that i feel this way. Why would I beat myself up for something that isn’t my fault. The same goes for my thoughts. Where do my thoughts come from? Where/how does a thought originate? It’s not necessarily my fault for the thoughts the come into my head. At far as I can tell, they come out of thin air. If I could, I would gladly push a button to only have positive thoughts. No reason to beat myself for something I can’t control.  Once that these realizations have really set in, I noticed that all of these feelings, emotions, and thoughts I’ve previously fought so much against have finally started to fade and in a sense I’m becoming more capable.

12936,"How to stop feeling like my friends hate me? - So, hi, I'm a 21F. I have a past quite full of bullying and disappointments with ""friends"". This happened in highschool. Highschool was by far the worst time of my life so far. It all eventually pushed me into depression and many, many panic attacks. A couple of years of psychiatry and escitalopram later and I feel a lot better, pretty much normal, thank god. I think my past left some scars, though. When I finally left highschool and came to college, I left all of the bad people behind, went to a city on the other side of the country, and met amazing people. AMAZING people! Whom I'm very lucky to call my friends. We're a pretty close group of 7 very different individuals and at this point I don't know how to live without them. Everything seems great, but the problem is I'm paranoid. If they organize something and end up not inviting me for some reason I feel so bad. I have had panic attacks over things like that (had one two days ago). And I know the problem is not them at all. I don't want to be this kind of person, that gets mad and acts passive aggressive. I don't want to get mad at people I care about so much. It's really not their fault. I don't have the right to create such uncomfortable situations for everyone. But I always feel like I'm not enough. My self esteem has always been pretty much non existant. Every little tiny situation makes my anxiety peak. The most ridiculous insignificant things about them. I feel like, deep down, they don't really like me. I'm constantly feeling ignored. I care a lot, about every little thing and everyone, and all my life I felt like I gave way more to people than what they gave me. But I think I'm just a bit above average on the caring spectrum, it's not them that don't actually care. I try too hard. I'm always worried I'm being annoying, always worried I'll do something wrong and they will stop hanging out with me. I never really talked to them about this. They have no idea. It's been 4 years of friendship and nothing has changed. I don't know what I can do about it, what to do to get better. I just wanted to be genuinely happy about them having fun, weather I'm there or not, and I just can't. I just get overwhelmingly anxious. Does anyone have any advice? Any tips or tricks?

I've never had a boyfriend (just short term relationship at summer camp or one night stands) and I was feeling lonely so I created myself a dating profile and met this nice guy who has a lot in common with me (same music tastes and he is a harry potter fan). We've been talking every two days on the internet and we're going on a date I guess (we met on tinder and he sent me the wink emoji a few times at the end of messages about going to a bar on saturday night) but I often get really nervous when I talk to people I don't really know, especially if that person is a guy. I become so nervous that I can't focus on ideas of topics to discuss, resulting in a lot of awkward silences. I really don't want to destroy my chances with him so I came to the internet for help (never been on reddit before) Please help me, I'm desperate...

12938,"When I compare myself to others at university I feel so inadequate - I’m 23 and I recently started my 3rd year of university. I took a few years off and dropped out after my first year so I’m a lot older than people I’m in class with. People I went to high school with are already graduated.  I have pretty bad SA and I just find it bizarre that everyone seems to have unlimited supply of energy to do so many things, except for me.   For example, if I have 1 class one day, I’ll revolve everything around that 1 class and that’s basically it for me. But then I’ll hear people talking about all the different clubs they’re a part of, maybe a job they have too, and I just think… wow, I literally could not do that.   I wish I could. I wish I were the type that could work like 2 days a week while I’m at school and also be part of a couple of clubs. But I just know it would be too much for me.   I love with my boyfriend and we’re both students, which helps I guess. I still have social interaction and we’re going to one club together. I just almost feel like he’s a crutch for me (he’s way more extroverted) because there’s no way I would if I lived alone. I feel like if I were here alone at university I would never leave my apartment due to my SA.   I guess I just feel really inadequate sometimes. And then I start to think about after university and all the social responsibilities and getting a career and all of that and it’s just overwhelming.

12940,"So I'm not a psychologist and not looking to press my issues on other people, but honestly reading ""I would say my parents took care of me well when I was a kid"" and comparing it to ""I'm not even that close with my family, I mean I call them sometimes and stuff but there's no sense of intimacy with them"" doesn't make sense.  People who have parents who can bond well, who can truly have an intimate relationship, go on to have a close intimate relationship with them.  The fact that you have these issues, and they haven't gone the extra mile to recognize it, get you help for it, and support you through them, tells me that they aren't real close to you.  I only really understood this when I heard someone call into Loveline and complain that all her boyfriends have been terrible people.  Dr Drew asked what her childhood was like and she kept saying it was ""perfectly normal, perfectly healthy"" and he kept digging, until she finally mentioned that she was alone a lot, and he asked how that could be as normally little kids aren't alone a lot, and she mentioned that her dad was in jail from when she was 8 to 17.

12941,"What one small step would you recommend to a person who feels he has no friends? - Hi,  I am a 20 year old undergrad student who would appreciate your advice on these 2 problems.   1. I don't have friends.  I mean, sure, I have acquaintances with whom I talk, but I can't feel them as friends. I heard talking with people can fix this. I talk to people, but only for any necessary information. I can not get close with anybody, and nobody gets close with me. This has been happening all my life.   2. I am always uptight and nervous in social situations, can not loosen up in front of people. It's like I am always on guard or something. I thought maybe this will get fixed in time, but it never did. Instead, I am getting more withdrawn from people as I am getting older and I do not know what to do.   I am sure there are solutions to this, but I tried everything I can think of ever since I was in grade 6. I forced myself to talk to people, joined clubs, even tried to blend in with others' choices.

12942,"A tip for dealing with social media anxiety that works for me - I am 15.  I am currently having social media anxiety, people that don't like me, girl I used to love showing up on people account, all kind of bad stuff.  The solution that works for me so far:   1. Unfollow every account that I need/ want to see (like companies, celebrities) 2. Create a new account and add back companies and celebrities that you like 3. Don't follow anyone from your social circle (My personally leave my family as followers)  &amp;#x200B;  What that does is to separate your real life and work life (or school life), I end up never checking the old acc again.  I have people that hate me, bully me, laugh at me in both real life and social media, but I know it doesn't matter because one day I will leave the school, leave the social circle and people that did bad things to me.  The thing is, don't let the people that are only temporary in your life ends up destroying your life, create contents, make posts, do the things that can gain experience in your life via social media.  &amp;#x200B;  Hope this help, have a nice day :D  &amp;#x200B;",reddit,1,1

12955,"Social anxiety is making me appear rude - Background info: I’m 18F  Long story short I’m a freshman in college and I have a dorm room in a student facility.  All the students on my floor know each other and hang out because, unlike me, they’re not awkward as shit and know how to socialize without having a damn panic attack.   Earlier today some girls from my floor were knocking on doors handing out invitations for some kind of event. They got to my door and when I heard them knock I just froze. I quickly turned off the lights to pretend I wasn’t there. Of course they saw the lights turn off from under the door.  I then heard them say: “Um that’s kinda rude... I guess you don’t want an invitation then.... Did she just turn her lights off?...Ooohh yeah that’s that girl...”  Hours later and I can’t stop overthinking the situation and don’t even wanna leave my dorm. I feel like an idiot. I don’t know why I didn’t just open the door like a normal human being. Pretty sure most people on my floor already dislike me because I don’t talk to them, avoid eye contact when I walk past them (the most I do is give them an awkward smile once in a while) and don’t participate in any of the activities they organize. They all seem very nice but I keep avoiding them and I’m just now realizing how rude my behavior is.   My room is right next to the public seating area (it’s the hangout spot) and everyone always sees me walk past and enter my dorm room so they all know what room I stay in and what I look like.   I wish I could just walk up to them and say “Hey, don’t mind me, I don’t know how to talk to people »   I’m not lonely or completely isolating myself from human contact. I do have some close childhood friends that go to the same college but they live close to campus so they don’t have a dorm and I always hang out at their spot.

I was really good in school, mostly A’s, but I was bullied. A lot. And it really affected my self confidence. I found it hard to make friends, and even harder to keep them. I was 15/16 when I finally started to make some friends. I came out as gay and things became a little easier and I found some friends that I was happy with.  Im now 24 and living in a big city that I love. I live near 2 very good friends, have a good apartment I love, a really nice housemate/landlord and although my job isnt paying well atm (my hours are low atm but are going up in the next few weeks) I really do enjoy it. I have a great boss and I literally feel that we can talk about anything, and I have come to become friends and I admire/look up to him quite a lot. And I also have become friends and  quite look up to his husband as well.   What I am going through now happened before in college and its really worrying me. In my last year I felt I had literally run out of conversations with my friends and we drifted apart. I found it hard to keep up any conversation or think of what to say. I could almost hear them being sick of me. Me and those friends barely talk anymore, and I finished college 2 years ago. I go through periods of being able to be a good conversationalist and these can last months and I form good friendships. Unfortunately, this can change VERY suddenly and I’m back to what I was like in college. These usually last a week or so. And it started again last week. But this time feels different, I dont know why. I went to my friends house last week and we didnt speak much. I dogsat for them last night and left shortly after I came home. My housemate isn’t being very talkative with me lately either.   The only person I have no trouble conversing with is my boss but I dont want to burden him with this.

To me it looks like perfectionism and shame - you consider yourself ""never good enough as you are"". Too inexperienced, too old, don't have a car etc etc. You are building the wall of excuses which allow you to take responsibility off your shoulders. It's not you - it's late start.

Do you have any advice on how to see if it could even be possible for me to deal with it? I'd like to think being thrown in the deep end will make me stronger but I'd like to know if it could be possible without finding out too late you know?  **TL;DR: I'd like to move country and develop my skills and start again but you know, bad anxiety and all that..**",reddit,1,1

12975,"Can you escape social anxiety? I have the determination to do whatever it takes. - I’m 22. Suffer from social anxiety but only just become aware of it. Yet looking back, it’s been so obvious my whole life lol. Problem with that is that my awareness has made it much worse. The awareness came once I tried meditation for little over a week - I became aware of everything I do and didn’t like myself for who I was. So I stopped, yet the awareness didn’t go. Now for me to function normally I have to take major changes. Stopped weed, alcohol, &amp; make sure to exercise. This helps majorly, I’ve figured that I need to continue meditation to fully feel the effects (I just don’t know). Always I have been socially anxious, yes, but the biggest problem with my awareness is that I have also realised my negative outlook on the world and patterns of behaviour that are selfish. So right now I’m overwhelmed with so much I want to change. On a brighter note, the meditation is helping me forgive myself for the fact that Im still gonna make mistakes, it’s ok just focus on the positives. Any tips for jobs or practices that may aid me? I mostly struggle with groups of more than 3 &amp; new people is fine only when 1on1",reddit,1,1
12976,"How do i approach people. - So im a male and i dont really know or understand how to approach others. I know people and people know me but throughout my life since i was 8 people didnt talk to me i had to start conversations with people if i wanted to talk. As a consequence of this it became tedious for me and i stopped doing so. The only difderence now is that i still dont have conversations with anyone unless i start the conversation. This even applies to family members, at least some. This made me become a socially awkward person and result to that was me feeling lonely. I want to change this for sure but i dont want to remake myself so others speak to me. I want to change this by talking to this girl that lives a couple houses from me. The big issue is that she is always with her mom and so am i since i help my mom carry the grocery bags. Everytime i walk by i want to say something but nothing comes out. The reason for that is because my mom will tend to question things like that from me since i dont usually do that. Not sure how to overcome this barrier anything helps.

12978,"As someone else mentioned, I think part of the anxiety for me as a person in their 20's (and it sounds like the same for you) is that there is the pressure to ""live your life to the fullest"" in your teens and 20's. And while that would be the ideal, it's not always feasible for someone dealing with anxiety and depression or other mental health issues. It's important to recognize that the things that people without these added pressures can do is not necessarily achievable for you right now, and that's not necessarily a bad thing; everyone goes at their own pace, and everyone needs help doing it. Therapy is (slowly) helping me come to terms with that.  Have you talked with your 3 friends about your struggles with anxiety? I've lost friendships as well because of my anxiety and depression, and the emotional breakdowns that resulted from it. A lot of them ended due to a lack of proper communication because of said issues. Maybe having an honest dialogue with your pals will help take off some of the weight of feeling like a ""nightmare.""",reddit,0,1

Well while were sitting at the table, I catch her eyes and we just kinda looking at each other and I could tell there was an attraction. Well it's like that the whole dinner and were walking to the car and I'm talking to her but I never asked her for her number or anything which I shouldve at the time. So my mom and I are driving home and I hit my mom with a question and say ""I think (the daughter) is in to me and shes not to bad herself, she like caught my attention. So fast forward to a few days later my mom got in a conversation with the daughters mom at work and got her snapchat. The mom asked the daughter if she could have her snapchat for me to talk to her. The daughter sends the snap code but said "" why didnt he ask me"" but I had no way to ask her except in person at the dinner.

12982,"Don't know if this is social anxiety, but i'm always trying to prove i'm better than others cause i feel that everyone thinks i'm the worst of the worst, this heavily impairs my life and social skills. - Lonely kid during my upbringing, thought no one liked me, since my parents did not have the time and my older sister used to lock herself in her room. I also had to do a surgery in my skull bone when i was 3, so i could not play too much with other kids who started thinking i was weird because of that. My family used to say i was an extremely smart kid, so i began using this smart kid persona to try and grab attention of other kids to no avail. Grew up insisting on this, with terrible results during my teenage years. I'm 22 now, and doing therapy and taking meds for anxiety, but i'm still on the beggining of my treatment.  I don't know if this counts as social anxiety, cause i'm not afraid of crowds, but i'm afraid of what they may think of me, and how their opinion may hinder the chances of me getting attention and stopping the hurtful, lifelong, loneliness. I feel like i must prove no one is better than me so people may approach, though, at subtle ways now that i'm older. I'm almost quitting college for the second time cause i'm afraid of bad grades making people think i'm not as smart as i look, i look for jobs only once every two years cause i'm afraid of not getting one and being called an incompetent person by my parents, i don't look for dates cause i'm extremely afraid getting rejected will make other people think i'm undesirable and unlovable. I don't do things that could end my loneliness cause i'm afraid failure to  to prove everyone i'm the greatest will only further this grief.

12984,"I was always shy as a kid, got bullied and was too afraid to say anything so it continued, then I developed low self esteem and learned to keep my feelings inside, which I still do today. I also had a lot of negative experiences, so rather than making a fool of myself or not wanting to look stupid or feel humiliated (because it happened before), this led to avoiding, which (of course) makes things worse. My parents didn't originally know how to ""parent,"" Children's Aid used to come to our home. But after that, my parents became overly protective. I only learned how to tie my shoes a few years ago (I am 16..) and by myself, and I don't have to do anything in my life because my mother does all of it, which I already know will impact me in future (encourages my avoidance and not knowing how to be independent). I bring up the topic of social anxiety sometimes, and they get the idea that I am asocial (as an extreme introvert) but won't accept that I am socially anxious. They say I am over exaggerating, others have it worse, we ALL experience anxiety, things like that.. so even as a kid, I never had anyone to go to about my feelings or problems. I don't allow myself to cry at home because they'd say I have no reason to, and I don't want my siblings seeing how ""weak"" I am, especially since I get random urges to cry and often not able to explain why.

12988,"Am I social anxiety or just introvert? - Hi, 21M. I can't figure it out what is going on in me. I've always been shy since I was a child and I've always found really difficult to make new friends. But in last 3 4 years I realized that it's like there are 2 side of myself: the one introvert and the extrovert one. When the extrovert one emerges, he makes people laugh and he's happy to be in social context; he makes me feel less lonely and appreciated. Although, in the last months it seems like this part of me is disappearing. For example yesterday, I was at a party with some people I know very well and other guys I didn't know. One of them come to me and presented himself. I've never seen this guy before. The first thing he said was: ""I know your type of person. Relax yourself, don't be so rigid. Remove all your mask and be simply yourself. The world can be yours, you should just believe it."" I was shocked. He is right. I'm always paranoid about what people may say or think about me. Even if it's really simple his suggestion, it seems so difficult to be simply myself.  Yesterday night, under this point of view, was terrible. I felt always awkward even if I was with people I know and I like. So my question is: am I just introvert of I have social anxiety? What should I do? I feel so bad.

I was never the one who made moves, I was too nervous and insecure. My lips get dry, my hands starts shaking and gets sweaty. It was horrible because I was so attracted to her, but I just couldn’t show it/turn it into action.   This made me stay away from dating until a couple of years ago. I’ve met with like 3 girls from tinder since then.   A couple of days ago I went for a walk with this really cute girl, and even though I was very nervous at first, it got better along the way. She wants to see me again which I’m really happy for, but I’m also a bit scared honestly. I’m 23 now, still a virgin and haven’t really kissed a girl before. I’ve had offers before, but I just never had the courage to do anything about it. I’m afraid that my lack of experience is going to ruin it for me. I know that she has been in a longer relationship before, so I think my lack of experience will be pretty obvious to her.

8804,"dear doctor of optometrists of the internet i am asking advice based on multiple different opinions. firstly i have two optometrists due to one having all my history and one recently that performs a more comprehensive exam. the one with my history told me i'd be more eligible and satisfied with icl, whereas my new optometrist said lasik. me being a worrier and avid researcher when making decisions went in for multiple consults. i had 3 lasik places that gave me the label of b- on candidacy and 1 that told me i was too borderline for it. they told me it was one and done procedure due to my high myopia. i'm 28 going on 29 male my script is l -8.75 sph -1.25 cyl axis 180 r -7.25 sph -2.00 cyl axis 180. my k value was 46 for both eyes where they said i'd be 38 post op. corneal thickness was 556 preop with 320 on my left and high 330s for my right. they set a treatment optic zone of 6.0. with lasik my concerns would be dry eye, ectasia, and night glare that may not be treatable and also outcomes you guys have seen with patients with high myopia treated with lasik because i'm hoping you guys have insight. icl was recommended due to its reversibility and less complications of dry eye and night vision problems also possibility of enhancement. my concern with icl is glaucoma. my great grandmother on of my dads mom and my moms dad had it. my eye pressure is around 19-20 mmhg. i have been told by all refractive surgery centers i'm in a unique position as i am a decent candidate for all. but lasik or prk would be a one time treatment. and i've been told to not due prk due to haze. in terms of stabilization i was a -7.5 l and -6.5 right at 18. with same astigmatism. at 27 i got -8.0 l and - 7.0 r. after not wearing contacts for examination i got the new script which was apparently due to my cornea going back to normal shape. i use to wear toric soft lenses. also i had lattice degeneration that was treated with laser by my retina specialist he said no other complications exist in terms of macula or optic nerve. i guess i'm kind of lost on the decision to make and wondering what professionals have seen with high myopic patients in terms of refractive surgery.",reddit,1,1,0.0077207363,0.9922793

8807,"hello, i've been briefly scanning this thread and i was hoping to have some answers from those directly affected by sjogrens syndrome... this will be sort of long in explanation but i'm generally discomforted and concerned. to begin, i'm 18/f. auto immune disorders like lupus and ra have been running in my family for some time and i've been experiencing symptoms that a doctor had suggested could be caused by sjogrens. this is a severe diagnosis and my family members with lupus explained it's taken them years to be officially diagnosed and that i should be concerned and get into contact with a rheumatologist. i wondered if it was worth it for my symptoms and if diagnosis was equally hard with sjogrens like lupus or if it's a true negative no matter what ? what finally lead to an official diagnosis for you all and what qualifies as enough in your opinion to seek a specialist? i experience the sensation of dry nose, throat mouth and eyes (occasionally itchiness of my eyes) causing my head to hurt, i'll randomly become dizzy and pressure will accumulate around my face. it's at its worst when i wake up and when im trying to sleep, however still very prominent throughout my day and noticeable. the best way i could describe it, is that it burns to breathe through my nose like things are too cold or not wet enough and it makes a dry, painful sensation in my throat despite posnasal drip. it irritates my mouth and eyes, feeling like i woke up with cotton mouth or i'm hung over. i struggle swallowing, making it hard to sleep as i constantly feel like there's a lump in my throat, i feel like i'm choking when my nose suddenly is dry and no longer ""clear""<u+009d>. it'll occasionally hurt to talk too long and i constantly have a dry cough because i'm always trying to subconsciously fix it. it's like feeling winded and having a dry spot in your throat from not swallowing enough so you constantly do it to fix it. it also makes me feel as though i swallow food down the wrong tube. i was only prompted with this diagnosis after being irritated enough to think i had strep throat and further explaining my symptoms. the test came back negative. on and off for the last year or two, i've exhibited these symptoms accompanied by weird facial burning like a sunburn sensation, excessive heartburn, occasional dizziness and aching of places where i've had broken bones prior or my joints, most generally being in my arms and legs. it has brief periods where it's barely noticeable and it's not a raging irritation. it's not that it hurts painfully bad usually, but rather its very mild and seems never ending enough for me to despise it and not ignore it. i was tested for lupus, sjogrens and ra all of which came back negative so my doctors are trying to move on (which is great if there's an actual solution) but i know how long it took my relatives to officially be diagnosed or finally dismissed. however, i'm still so uncomfortable and now my doctors seem to be testing me for things that don't exactly make sense as a whole like influenza or lyme. they've also attributed my symptoms to be caused by anxiety and stress as i have a lot going on however, if anyone in this thread knows what anxiety dryness, numbness/weakness or throat irritation is like, you'll too, know that it's not the same as what i'm describing- it being that it's not a response to adrenaline or worrying. what i experience is rather constant. (as for the lab tests, i'll have the results monday the 13th) my symptoms fluctuate in intensity and lately my body is becoming less dry as i think it's overcoming the intensity from this ""flare""<u+009d> as my aunt with lupus suggests. i still have the sensation of dryness 2/3 times but there's clearly moisture in at least my mouth right now. like my mouth for example, it's usually extremely dry due to my nose being dry and it leads to dry eye and pain in my face. now it seems to be less intense. (i don't know if that's from the help of biotene or eye drops however). it was a strong few months of it climaxing to its worst and my symptoms by no means have completely subsided. i recognize what i'm feeling from this time last year and from when i suspect that it's began as a whole, the end of summer both years in a row, now. i do have seasonal allergies but they present with congestion, pressure in different places... so i've ruled that out. also is it normal to have dry crusty sensation in the nose and eyes even with some moisture being present? sounds silly, i know... and does anyone find that the more water they drink the headache increases or that spit becomes more thick and harder to swallow?.. ive tried sinus meds, eye drops that sometimes burn but usually feel so relieving ( meant for moisture) saline spray which dries me out and burns- i now use something specifically for moisture but i feel like it just drops to my throat and irritates, i've tried cold and flu meds... i constantly moisturize as i've struggled with dry skin since i was a little girl and still my skin gets patchy or my lips will peel and crack ( i use chapsticks and scrubs like it's my job! it makes no sense)... i drink upwards of two gallons of water trying to remain comfortable, using biotene sprays and eye drops and coconut oil for moisture. i take ibuprofen for pain and use heating pads for pain as well. a humidifier is present and i try to keep room on the colder side. i have central air heating. hydration is very important to me as it's been an irritant in my life for a long time, suddenly it doesn't seem as effective as normal. i do not drink coffee and i've cut out smoking or vaping for 4-5 months now. i was hoping to see if my symptoms are still valid of sjogrens or if maybe there's hope for something else less serious that i could bring up in an appointment for those of you who had their sjogrens misdiagnosed originally? maybe i'm experiencing symptoms of something else. more blatantly said, i'm not looking for a diagnosis but, rather, i'm trying to become more educated on the topic as i'm losing sleep from the irritation, constant urination and am generally very discomforted all day. online research is hard and cryptic in my opinion, as well as not always accurate. i figured asking real people would be more beneficial. i'm open to any and all suggestions if you've read this far. the best to you all who struggle with an auto immune issue especially sjogrens. thanks again!! please ask any questions you may need for a better understanding, i'm very desperate as health issues spark my anxiousness and work me up lol i'm sorry if i sound dumb or should be asking in a different subreddit.",reddit,1,1,0.005836747,0.9941632

8809,"i got diagnosed 10 yrs ago as a teen, have been through nearly everything. i second diet and supplement treatment, as i tried plaquenil and had more negatives than positive. i've come to terms that my sjogren's isn't going away, but if i can prolong the best of my health then i will. with plaquenil, i was cranky/snippy all the time, more sensitive to sunlight (became practically a hermit), and severe tummy issues. i had less joint pain, but that was about it. i've found the right supplement mix with the help of a naturopath, and sticking to a balanced diet has allowed for long-term steady health. i found the mediterranean diet was best for me (though i skip the wine part); i stay away from inflammatory foods like red meat, rather sticking to anti-inflammatory stuff like garlic, turmeric, etc. i really like fish for the omega-3s. and i drink a shitton of water too. obviously, i'm not a doctor, so check in with a doctor first if you can. also, i do have a pre-hypothyroidism situation going on, and it seems that the neck lumps is a concern of yours based on other comments. i take a supplement to pull back on that and get my thyroid back to normal, and that has helped my jawline come back a bit. i'd advise asking a doctor to check on other autoimmune or thyroid issues as well, as where there's one autoimmune issue, there's more stuff going on. lastly, i know that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but acupuncture has helped me the most with gland reduction and proper salivation, to a point my dentist pointed it out at my regular checkup after starting acu treatments. my chronic pain has also definitely gone way down. i'm very lucky in that my insurance covers it, and it's definitely not for everyone, just my experience. everybody's bodies are different, and a lot of folks with autoimmune issues tend to have a fun lil cocktail of stuff going on. find a doctor you trust who's willing to figure out your situation and determine the best fit for your needs. if you're interested in more natural remedies, i recommend a naturopath. if you prefer western medicine and get more benefits from plaquenil, a primary care doc and *especially* a rheumatologist are your best bet.",reddit,0,0,0.9993082,0.0006917508

8852,"i've had a consistent prescription for about 20 years and have excellent vision (corrected). my previous glasses have started to fall apart, so i went to a highly recommended optometrist (i.e. not a discount shop or a costco/walmart) to get new glasses. my exam showed that my previous prescription is fine. my prescription is -3.75, -3.50 spherical (no cylinders, no progressives, etc). upon receiving my new glasses, i noted a vertical line of distortion approx 5-10<u+00b0> off my visual center, away from the center of my face in both lenses - the right being more noticeable. this vertical line causes images to blur, but as i turn past it the image returns to the same level of sharpness as my visual center. eventually, the image blurs as expected heading toward the edge of the lens. my guess would be that the index of refraction is slightly different here - a degree or two wide. when marking this effect on my lens, it is about 1 cm out from my optical center (i.e. not an edge distortion). the effect is less noticeable up close (like reading a book), but very noticeable driving or looking at fine detail beyond about 10 ft or so (e.g. tv screen across room, map on wall). additionally, my right eye is slightly blurry, mostly in distance vision (beyond the \~10 ft range). when looking anywhere but up close, its causes my vision to be distracting - like i need to rub my eye and clear it up. as expected, when using only my right eye the blurriness is much more noticeable than when combined, but still aggravating when using both eyes. oddly, i inadvertently noticed while rubbing my eye, that when my glasses slide up so the nose piece rested on top of my nose, my vision becomes sharp in both eyes. marking on the lens, this is about 2 cm out and 2 cm down from optical center. i don't know if that matters, but i figured i'd mention it as my my vision is great in that position, but it obviously looks ridiculous. i've returned to the opticians multiple times. they remanufactured the lenses thinking there was some sort of defect multiple times. i did note a slight improvement on the left side, but its really hard to compare as each remake has been about a month apart. i'd had to argue with them a bit to explain that i wasn't talking about edge distortion and get them to actually listen to what i described. i've also been told it is because my lenses are wider, so i am looking through more material when i look off axis. i find that unlikely at 5-10<u+00b0> off axis, plus it clears up after a narrow distortion. the next to last time i went in, they asked me to go more than a couple days and try a full two weeks as my eyes needed more time to adjust (i've never taken more than a day or so to adjust in the past, but i'm getting older, so maybe). they have checked the as-made prescription, my old glasses (prescription matches), and reverified my measurements against the as-built. on my final visit (after a full two weeks of dealing with this annoying blurriness), i went in to the doctor instead of the optician. she verified my prescription and suggested that maybe the coating is causing an issue or a material change could be causing the difference. i brought my old glasses back in and they saw that they were polycarbonate (my new lenses are trivex). the optician told me that i just need to wait longer to adjust. i'm at 2.5 weeks of wearing them all the time. i feel like the office has just written me off - they already lost money on remaking the lenses a couple times. i don't know what to do. if it was just the vertical distortion, i could probably learn to try and ignore it. i feel like my options are: 1) accept them as is and hope more weeks of waiting pay off 2) return them and go back to old glasses until the fully disintegrate 3) take current glasses to another optometrist and see if they have a better solution/idea of what is happening 4) return the glasses, go somewhere else, hope that i don't have the same issue i've been wearing glasses for some 30 years now and the only thing i've had like this was a prescription made wrong in one eye which was quickly corrected and worked great. thanks in advance for your responses.",reddit,0,0,0.9986136,0.001386343

[this image]( illustrates what i mean quite well. by suggesting a smaller diameter frame (which the second one is), you basically guarantee that the lenses will be cut out into a smaller shape, meaning thinner at the edges. so yes, the second frame is a much better choice for you. to sum up, there isn't a lot you can do besides going for an even smaller frame, which i undestand if you don't want to do, or going for 1.74, which is quite a lot more expensive than a 1.67. another option is to look at some frames sold elsewhere, perhaps online. you might find some acetate frames with nosepads that might suit you, and specsavers (at least here in the uk) offer a service where you bring in your own frame for them to put new lenses in. hope that helps!",reddit,0,0,0.9997843,0.00021575349

8911,"this is going to be a long history but i'd love to hear insight if anyone has ever experienced anything similar. i've got a ton of doctors involved but would love to give this a shot. i am 31 years old and i have always been healthy. within the last few months i've noticed that i started having a tremor in my right hand, a lot of weakness in my hand and a lot of pain in my feet. i have a hard time walking when i wake up in the morning or when i've been sitting for awhile. the best way i can describe it is that the bones ache. i have been clumsy and dropping things a lot. i've also been having issues with my vision - but really couldn't pinpoint what the issue was. sometimes i feel like i'm looking through water and my depth perception is off. i do have 3 kids under the age of 5 but i am beyond exhausted. i sleep great at night but i just wake up so so tired. i got my family doctor involved about 6 weeks ago. she did an examination and ran a huge panel of blood work. she also referred me to a neurologist. all of my blood work has come back normal. i went to the eye dr as well and explained what was going on and she didn't see anything concerning but didn't like my symptoms. she agreed with the neurologist referral. i saw the neurologist about a month ago. it was a very long appointment with a physical exam and history. he ended the appointment explaining that he thinks i have an issue with my peripheral nervous system. the initial concern with my eye dr and family dr was possibly ms. the neurologist said he didn't think so. he ordered an emg (still waiting) and an mri (scheduled for oct 2). the neurologist believed my optic nerve looked okay and didn't think there was any optic neuritis. ffwd to last week. my husband and i were watching a hockey game and i took my glasses off to look at my phone. i looked up and realized that i could actually read the score. my vision is -3.50 in both eyes and i can basically just see blurred color without my glasses on. i then realized that only my right eye could see well. my left was still the same. i booked in to see my eye dr again the next day. she was immediately concerned. she did a pressure test and read that my right eye was now a 0.0. it had fully improved to 20/20 vision. she did some scans and showed me that my macula looked very strange and that it appeared to be wrinkled. she said i needed to be seen by an ophthalmologist. she told me that typically what causes the macula to wrinkle is from pressure behind the eye. this is also what causes the improved vision as it shortens the lens of the eye. she told me her concern was that there may be a tumor behind my eye. cue freaking out. the next day i was seen by an ophthalmologist at the hospital. he did a ton of tests and scans and agreed with my optometrists concerns. he saw the wrinkling on my macula and sent me straight for a ct. he told me his concern was also a tumor. 2 hours later i was back in his office and he gave me the news that the ct was clear. no tumor. he said he was extremely surprised as he was quite convinced it was a tumor. he then told me i needed to be seen by a retina specialist as he believed the blood vessels behind my eye were swollen and had no idea on the reason. again, the next day, i saw the retina specialist. he must have spent 30 minutes looking at my eye at a ton of different angles. he said ""wow this is an interesting one for a saturday morning!""<u+009d> he thought maybe my optic nerve was a bit swollen but not very much. he also agreed that i had coroidal folds on my macula and had absolutely no idea why. he is a renowned doctor and said he's very stumped by my case and said he will dig deep to find answers. he said he believes there is sort of rate condition or disease causing this. he said the vision shift from a -3.50 to a 0 is extremely concerning and that we absolutely need to find the cause. on monday i have a ton more scans at his office, an ultrasound and a fluorescein angiography. he's going to be working with my neurologist to see if they can figure out what's going on. i feel scared and also just really tired. i want to know what's going on and no one seems to have a clue. if you made it this far - i appreciate your thoughts and time! here's to a diagnosis sometime soonish!",reddit,1,1,0.0051929737,0.99480706

8914,"it's possible you were having issues getting the best prescription because your eyes have been dry. dryness will alter the surface of your eye. this can cause fluctuating astigmatism values or inaccurate measurements from the machines or whoever is doing the refraction (optometrist most likely). regardless of what you choose to do, is recommend treating the dry eye aggressively to see if this helps your overall situation. use an artificial tear 4 times a day in both eyes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). use the drop even if you don't feel you need it. if you use the tears more than 4-6 times a day, switch to a preservative free variety. also, don't use anything with a redness reducer. so avoid visine, clear eyes, ophcon, naphcon, and lumify. i'd suggest a brand like refresh, blink, systane, liquitears, genteal, or theratears. there are a bunch of brands but you can use any, even the cheapest is a good place to start. in addition, do a hot compress once a day for 5 minutes (heat a washcloth under hot water and rest it on the closed eyes). once the 5 minutes are over, take the heat off the eyelids and gently massage the eyelids with your fingers. this will also help improve the quality of your tears. furthermore, if you work on screens often or read a lot or do focused near work (knitting, puzzles, crosswords, painting...), this is contributing to your dry eye surface. follow what's called the 20/20/20 rule. every 20 minutes is focused work/tv/computer..., take a 20 second break where you look up from what you're doing and look 2 feet away. it will help remind you to blink and reduce strain. you should also put an extra eye drop in before doing your focused activity to help keep the surface lubricated. another important thing to know is your age. if you're under 16, your glasses are much more important for the health of your eyes and you need the most accurate prescription. if you're older than that, wearing any glasses won't hurt your eyes. but if you're wearing the wrong prescription, things will be blurry and you're more likely to get eye strain and headaches while using the glasses. just because you are given a prescription for glasses doesn't mean you have to get it. if you're concerned the prescription isn't great, get another opinion and a new refraction (preferably after treating your dry eyes for at least 2-4 weeks). you'll be glad it only cost you a glasses exam fee instead of having to buy two pairs of glasses (which can get quite costly).",reddit,0,0,0.999796,0.00020408287

(doctor said i have slight astigmatism, but not near the threshold for needing correction. this contact didn't really fix it, so hopefully that is not my issue. besides, toric lenses did *not* agree with me, pretty uncomfortable.) * air optix night & day, -2.0 in on eye and -2.25 in another eye. no change. * air optix (same plain version), increased strength to -2.25 in both eye. better, but still out of focus.

9000,"a few years ago i began having slight issues with my vision. at first it was just that with certain headlights ( i think the newer led ones) i would see a duplicate set of headlights underneath it but in blue. it literally looks like they installed a separate set of headlights right under the first but in blue. initially it was only when i looked out the side of my eyes but has since become an all time thing. then came the motion blur with anything lit up in a dim room. a remote, my phone, whatever had any glow to it will leave a very slow light trail behind it. then came motion blur with anything white. flipping through a book, wiping something with a paper towel etc. then the colors that shouldn't be there showed up. usually it's purple ( when looking at an all white spot like a field of snow, or at a red light a purple haze will be under the red glow) but sometimes is blue. also when i look across anything lit up a flash of light goes the opposite way. if theres a candle for example and i look to the left of it, i will immediately get a flash of light going to the right. i have recently begun seeing random flashes of purple in my peripheral vision. i also have motion blur now with pretty much anything. my own hands ( i'm a brown skinned person so they're not white at all) and anything i move with them. i also now struggle to see white lit things like the captions on television which now also have a blue outline, and the time on my stove. i also struggle with getting my brain ro let go of an image it has seen. a lot of times it's the pattern of the brake lights from the car in front of me , sometimes 10 minutes after i have seen them. i have eye drs who listen and examine me thoroughly but see nothing wrong with my eyes. in the past year my vision got blurrier and it seems like every thing would be fine if there was just more light. i did get a new prescription and am waiting for the glasses to come in so maybe that will help with the blurriness but it's been odd. also when i'm looking at my phone what looks like a negative image of what i'm seeing flashes to the side of my screen. and today the sun was high on the right upper section of my vision but i saw a dark spot the same size as it on my left as well. i am 36 years old. i have a family history of macular degeneration and i myself have somewhat controlled diabetes. i get diabetic eye exams yearly. no visual damage is there. i recently tried seeing a new dr who gave me a test to check how things were with my brain since my eyes seem fine. she sat me in front of a screen with a wire on my scalp and had me watch a tv screen of black and white images. she said the results came back as me having "" a delay"" but won't say what that means only that she wants to talk to my neurologist. . this has been several weeks of anxiety and worrying and i still have no answers because she keeps forgetting about me. of importance , probably, is the fact that i have had 3 mris over the years to check for ms because of odd sensations and muscle movements that are otherwise unexplained. all have come back unremarkable, the most recent a few months ago. it was ordered because in december of 2019 i developed nearly non stop twitching in my eyes and the muscles surrounding them. the twitching eventually spread to my cheeks and lips and has calmed down most everywhere now except my eyes, both of which have fluttering anywhere from right below my eyebrows to my under eye area. it's happening nearly continuously although it's only sometimes visible . the only sites i can find about the test i had showing a delay basically said it's a clear indication of ms. while i definitely don't want ms , if that's where this is heading after all these years of "" is it or isn't it"" then i definitely want to know and to get any meds i can to slow progression. but even when i looked into ms visual symptoms nothing i have been going through seems to be mentioned minus the blurred vision which may be age related regression. all this said.. does anyone have any suggestions to what may be going on? i am uncomfortable using my vision as it is but am terrified of it getting worse or losing it. could this be ms? something else? any advice or ideas would be great, google is not my friend but is coming up empty handed anyway.",reddit,1,1,0.0061200513,0.9938799
9001,i'm -5.0 myopic in both eyes and i'm now 36. my vision got bad enough to need glasses when i was about 12 and it got steadily worse until i was in my twenties. but then it settled down and my prescription rarely changes much these days. when you've stopped growing your prescription should settle down a bit. i don't believe there's any research which shows that wearing corrective lenses has a big impact on future vision. most people's myopia is down to the shape of the eye rather than usage. of course when you get older you'll experience changes in your comfortable reading distance but that'll be down to your age and the reduced flexibility of the lens in your eye. but that's a different thing to being short-sighted. so don't worry. with your level of short-sightedness and your age i very much doubt it will get too much worse.,reddit,1,1,0.0050877403,0.99491227

(if i have to, i have to, of course). if there's a risk to waiting, though, i'll get what i need to done. 4. what value does the dye study have diagnostically? 5. is there a chance that the relatively rapid decline in my a1c/sugar levels can cause something like this? i read anecdotally that doing so can cause retinopathy to flareup. if so, whats the likelihood that this will fade with time? is there a way to determine if this is the case? i appreciate any insight or experience you care to share. thanks!",reddit,1,1,0.011104506,0.98889554

9121,"yes, you do have to insert and remove your contact lenses every day. it is tricky at first but most people get pretty good at it within a few weeks. they shouldn't be uncomfortable if they fit well. but getting a good fit can be a challenge for kc patients. you want to find the best fitter you can. you need someone with the experience and the patience needed to fit kc patients. because kc is rather rare, only a few contact lens fitters become good kc lens fitters. some doctors are better than others at prescribing glasses for kc patients. i have had kc for over 50 years. when i was first diagnosed, kc lenses and fitting technology was primitive compared to today. i wore glasses for many years because they couldn't find comfortable contact lenses for me. when i found someone who had the knack for prescribing glasses for me, i stuck with them until they retired. here are a few ideas that might help with helping your doctor find a good glasses prescription. the critical part of the exam is the subjective refraction with the phoropter. this is where you look through the funky ""glasses"" and select ""which is better, 1 or 2?"" remember, it is the prescription that is being tested, not you. you are the grader. don't strain or use tricks to try to see better. just try to give each lens prescription presented to you an honest review based on the way you'd want to see through your glasses. rather than trying to decide which image is better, something that has less meaning for someone with kc, try selecting the image you prefer. if both are bad, maybe in different ways, just say so. same if both images are ok and you don't have a preference. if you can describe what makes the images bad, that may help your doctor. if you have a good rapport with your doctor, which is really helpful for kc patients, you might pass on these tips: ""use 0.50ds steps or more when assessing sphere and cyl. it is often easier to assess the cyl before finalizing sphere correction, as large amounts of uncorrected astigmatism cause excessive ghosting."" that is advice for fitting kerasoft contact lenses, but it would apply to any subjective refraction of a kc patient. what makes prescribing glasses tricky for kc patients is that you can't just methodically zero in on a good prescription like you can with normal eyes. with kc, things can get better, then worse, then better again as they try a series of lenses. your doctor may have to spend time just jumping around trying to find the magic combination of sphere and cylinder power that works for you. you need someone who finds this interesting and is willing to spend the time playing with things. it will help if you can book your appointment at a time when the office is less busy and ask that they give the doctor extra time to spend with you because of your kc. i have seen some surprisingly good result with glasses despite my kc. my doctors have sometimes let on that they were surprised too.",reddit,0,0,0.99964786,0.00035213333

9130,"hi everyone. i'm a 27yo woman, severely nearsighted (don't remember my prescription anymore, but it was above -10 for both my eyes, with a little bit of astigmatism in both). i had icl surgery when i was 23. the reason for this was because i had stopped being able to tolerate contact lenses at 21, after 5 years of consistent use. i developed chronic dry eyes that were never successfully treated - i tried different things for them, never worked, and learned how to simply manage day by day. because of my severely high myopia and having to go back to wearing impossibly thick glasses, i became depressed. people started making fun of me again just like they did in school. the guy i was seeing literally broke up with me over this. i couldn't go to the beach anymore because everything was so blurry, it caused me panic attacks. i quit surfing, which i loved, because of this. i thought my life was over. i tried very hard and pleaded with several doctors to let me try alternative kinds of contact lenses, like rgps or sclerals. i was particularly excited about sclerals since they seem to be indicated for people with dry eye. my doctors always dismissed me, saying contacts would never work for me after what he had happened, and so did my parents. no one advocated for me and i was too young and too much of a pushover to advocate for myself. eventually, and because my prescription was stable for several years, i was told i could get icls. lasik was obviously always out of the question due to my prescription. i got the surgery done and my vision was never 20/20, there was always some residual nearsightedness and astigmatism that was never fully corrected. i never minded this because i hadn't been fully corrected in years anyway, and my sight was quite good and clear. lately i've been wondering about what my options are if my vision worsens. i do not want to wear glasses ever again after the amount of unhappiness and trauma they've given me. i was talking to my mother about wearing contact lenses if i ever needed them again, and she casually dropped a bomb on me - ""the doctor told us after your surgery that you'll never be able to wear contact lenses again""<u+009d>. they hadn't told me this before. will i never be able to try wearing contacts again after icl? if this is the case i would've never gone forward with the surgery back then and would've pressed more for scleral lenses. what are my options if my vision worsens in the future? is glasses really the only thing i can do? are sclerals just not a possibility anymore?",reddit,1,1,0.0067514074,0.9932486

9139,"thanks, i am glad you find them informative. side effects: 1. when i take them out at night (16 hours of wear), they leave a temporary indentation on my sclera (white part of eye). this usually goes back to its normal position within an hour. i told my doctor about this and they said it is normal and does not negatively impact the health of the eye. 2. this also happens when i remove the lenses, my eyes get extremely bloodshot for at least 30 minutes. this is a reaction as the lens is pulled off of the sclera. blood rushes to the area as the tissue rebounds to the normal position. again, this is normal and not harmful, according to my doctor. precautions: 1. i don't wear them in the shower and i never take a nap in them under any circumstances. hypoxia risk is always present, as with any contact lens. my sclerals are made of an extremely oxygen permeable material that allows more oxygen to pass through than most soft contact lenses. i don't take them out for 18 hours after i put them in. i was told by my doctor that this is fine, but if my eyes started to feel irritated, remove the lenses. it's never been an issue. the first week i had the sclerals, i did have bubbles under the lenses after installation a couple times. this required immediate removal and reinstall. but now that it's been 6 months, i never have the issue. i can have both installed in about 1 minute (30 seconds per eye). it sounds like your eye doc isn't well trained in sclerals and fitting (no offense). my doc had the proper fit and lens shape within 5 minutes. also taught me to install them in another 5 minutes. your doc is correct in that if bubbles start forming at the edge of the lens, something is wrong with the fit and would need to be removed immediately. you want a good seal to keep the tear exchange minimal. also means the lens is properly resting on your eye for optimal visual clarity. there are gp lenses that are more oxygen permeable than soft lenses. these are the lenses i wear (with the hydrapeg coating): 6 months ago, before my sclerals, i was also in that deep dry-eye induced depression. i was using hundreds of dollars of otc lubricating eye drops and several hundred dollars per month on prescription eye medications (steroids, xiidra). i was so pissed. i paid 8k cash for the best, newest version of lasik available. and it almost ruined my life. i tried everything and nothing kept my eyes moist enough to not feel dry. it severely impacted my visual acuity. i couldn't drive in low light and in the daytime i had severe halos and glare on just about object. fast forward to today, i have sclerals. but i can see better than ever before in my life. it feels like i can see forever. night vision is fine. my eyes never feel dry. i don't spend hundreds of dollars on eye drops every month. life is better. definitely look into sclerals again. let me know if you have any questions!",reddit,0,0,0.9932201,0.006779842

9262,"most likely thing you have is dry eyes. focused activity line computer work, tv, driving, reading... all contribute to dry eye because your brain forgets to blink. this allows the surface of the eye to dry out and become irregular. this is what causes the blurry vision. i'd recommend a few things. first, use artificial tears on a regular basis 4 times per day, even if you don't think you need it. this will help keep the surface regular. second is to use the 20-20-20 rule. every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break by looking 20 feet away. this helps break up your tasks and reminds you to blink. the recent quarantine with increased computer time (and decreased sleep) have likely made it worse. as far as amblyopia (sounds like this is what you're describing as your right eye not seeing as well as your left), there is likely little more that can be done to improve the blurry vision. amblyopia is a poor communication between the eye and the brain. the eyes have to learn how to talk to the brain when you're a child. there are many things that can cause poor communication between the eye and the brain (i.e. different glasses prescription between the eyes, one eye having more astigmatism than the other, cataract in one eye, eyelid drooping in one eye...). if this isn't corrected, the brain and eye lose the ability to learn how to communicate and that blur becomes permanent. kids who wear patches are being treated for amblyopia by covering their good eye and forcing their bad eye to learn that communication. after the age of about 12-16, that period that the eye and brain can learn to talk is mostly over. there are some studies showing there may be some benefit to amblyopia treatment in certain types of people up into their mid teens (usually people who've never had any amblyopia treatment, and the later the amblyopia treatment starts, the less improvement can be expected). lasik doesn't affect amblyopia. you can think of lasik as getting your glasses prescription lasered into your cornea. it can't sharpen the vision in the amblyopic eye because the communication from eye to brain simply isn't there. another way to think about it is the eye being a camera that is connected to a computer via a cable. the cable is the optic nerve and the computer is the brain. amblyopia causes a problem in the computer itself. so everything else in the system looks normal but it still produces a blurry picture. you could put glasses or contacts on the camera, you could even do lasik on the camera, but there's still a processing problem causing the blurry vision. it doesn't mean you can't have lasik but it does mean your bear vision after the procedure is still limited.",reddit,0,0,0.9999082,9.17835e-05

9284,"since this post might be a little long i put a tldr at the bottom. some background: i have a really high prescription (10). i am in college away from home, so two weeks ago i went to an ophthalmologist to get a dilated exam to check on my retinas and get my yearly checkup. i wanted to get this appointment specifically with an ophthalmologist rather than an optometrist since i haven't noticed a significant change in vision (prescription wise) and since its been a few years since i was dilated. my last appointment before lockdown only did some imaging tests (i think an oct), and i remember i wasn't dilated. i am well aware of the risks of my high prescription and know the general symptoms to look out for (new floaters, flashes, dark curtain) if i need to drop everything and see an eye doctor. i have had floaters since i was 12. now here goes - i get flashes in the exact same spots, in both eyes, when i move them rapidly, particularly against bright white backgrounds. i was under the impression that flashes due to tears/detachments happen regardless of eye movement, and they are usually severe and apparent. i didn't know what i was seeing was ""flashes"" until i moved my eyes rapidly with the intent of seeing them, and compared this to a what i've been reading. well, now i can't un-see them. i notice them much more often now, but still only with rapid eye movements in bright settings. this was a major reason for the appointment. i am fairly certain i have been ""seeing"" these flashes for a few years. anyhow, here's how the appointment went. he did the visual tests for my prescription and only raised my prescription up a touch (after a ~~little~~ scare as i had never seen plus cylinder notation before), which was a little bit of a relief suggesting my prescription might be starting to stable out. i talked to him about the flashes, so he dilated my eyes, used a slit lamp, and in a separate test i remember him looking around in my eye, having me look all the way up, left, right, down, through a handheld bright light. he said my retina looked healthy, and that the flashes are likely due to the vitreous fluid tugging on my retina, which can be triggered by the rapid eye movement. he gave me my new prescription and sent me on my way. i lurk here and on similar subreddits, and have read some comments about the how direct ophthalmoscopy is limited in observing the periphery, versus say indirect ophthalmoscopy. i've also read some scare stories about tests like this missing tears in the far periphery which then progress into detachments. which, of course, gets me concerned. i am planning on getting another appointment with my regular optometrist when i get back home in a month anyway. so, my questions are: is direct ophthalmoscopy typically sufficient for identifying tears, holes, or the like? i know indirect ophthalmoscopy is generally better. is it urgent that i find a new appointment immediately with another eye doctor in town and get a more thorough test, or should i keep the one i have in a month? when i have my new appointment, what kinds of tests, if any, should i ask for? specific imaging? sorry about the length, and i apologize if questions like this aren't appropriate on this subreddit, but thank you for your help. tldr: high prescription. seen flashes for a few years. went to see an ophthalmologist very recently. doctor said i'm fine and attributed them to vitreous. is direct ophthalmoscopy sufficient in finding tears, and would it behoove me to get a second opinion urgently vs in a month?",reddit,0,1,0.015124603,0.9848754

(that said: if a pregnant woman is getting good prenatal care and has never tested positive for diabetes, in the latter stages of pregnancy she is **not** going to suddenly get diabetes so bad that she develops vr traction.) here is an american academy of ophthalmology resource for flashes and floaters: [what are floaters and flashes? - american academy of ophthalmology (aao.org)](",reddit,0,0,0.99989533,0.00010460121

9398,"hi guys, my rx hasn't changed in the last 9 years. i had always worn contact lenses, but in the last year had to start wearing glasses more frequently due to my eyes drying out/disorientation and extreme tiredness with the contacts in. i had the same pair for those 9 years (again, rarely wore them). the style is dated and the lenses are scratched, so after my optometry appt, i ordered a new pair. my old frames were plastic, rectangular and the lenses fairly thick (-4.75 and -5.0), but not heavy or noticeable to others. these were very comfortable for me. i received my new pair and can't wear them due to disorientation and distortion. i will also see an entire lampshade (if the light is on )in the corner of my glasses, when the light isn't in my peripheral vision. the lenses are thinner and less curved as well. this optometrist changed my axis from 110 to 134, despite me being told my mild astigmatism would have the same numbers (this was a new optometrist). not sure if that's an issue. these lenses also have nose pads and thus sit farther from my eyes, which i also dislike. the lenses are also much thinner (polycarbonate) and much less curved (my old glasses almost wrap around the outer corners of my eyes , which seems to help). they are also not as wide as my rectangular glasses, so perhaps this is part of the issue. i'm fine with these lenses as long as i don't turn my head or my eyes. once i do that, it's a dizzying mess. i'm trying to get the same lenses i had before, because while they aren't thin, they're comfortable and the way they look on me doesn't cause me to look bug eyed etc. any suggestions on what to look for? all i seem to be able to find available with my rx are polycarbonate/high index. i honestly don't know what my old lenses are made from (definitely not glass. i'm leaning towards regular plastic) and without seeing anything else as an option anywhere, i'm a little concerned. thank you and pardon my ignorance. nearly 10 yrs behind on lens updates, i guess i should've been updating my frames more often.",reddit,0,0,0.9998449,0.000155082

9446,"the question has already been answered but just to add a little detail: there is no number at which you become blind once you hit it. optometry is part physics part health care. glasses correction is the physics part of it. as long as there is a focal point on your retina, and as long as the path to it is clear, and as long as the signal can reach your brain from your eyes, it is possible to correct it with glasses. if you are hypermetropic, plus powered, there is a limit to how high a power you will need because the eyeball is only so long. i'm not saying there's a limit to how high we can correct, rather i'm saying there's a limit to how high we'll ever need to correct. so you don't really see people with plus power that goes that high. if you are myopic, negative power, the number needed can get much higher to correct your vision. i've seen as high as -29, and i'm sure others have seen higher. it definitely is a little more difficult to correct vision that high, partially because the higher your correction needs to get the less likely to doctor will have the lenses on hand to neutralize it in an exam. but also because the higher your prescription gets, the more likely other factors such as minification and vertex distance will have a significant impact on your correction. but it is still possible to correct vision that high. as i said as long as there is a focal point and there's a clear path to it and their is signal to the brain then you can correct it with glasses. some diseases, like cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, corneal scarring, and others cause the clear tissues that let light into the eye to become cloudy or opaque. because light can't pass through, no matter how strong or weak your glasses are, that would be considered blindness. other diseases, like macular degeneration or retina detachment, causes the focal point to be ""crumpled up"" for lack of a better word. that can also cause blindness. and yet other diseases, such as stroke, glaucoma, brain tumors, can affect the optic nerve which connects your eyes to your brain. in this case there's nothing wrong with the eyes but you're still blind because the brain gets no signal. high prescriptions are associated with higher risk of eye diseases. so it's definitely true that if you have a really high prescription you are more likely to go blind, but there's no amount of prescription that guarantees you to go blind. and overall the average risk to any single person of going blind is pretty low and can usually be avoided with routine eye exams.",reddit,0,0,0.9998795,0.00012049396

9469,"i'm going to try to keep this as brief and relevant as possible, but so far there is a lot to cover. i will try to keep it chronological as well. **january 2010 (17 years of age)** \- optic nerve ""swelling"" noticed on routine exam. mri done to rule out iih. mri was normal, more images taken. optic disc drusen diagnosed in right eye only. at the time, they were ""buried"" drusen and were not considered significant. told at the time to monitor yearly by doing a visual field test at each eye exam and self-monitor for changes in color vision. **2010 - 2019** \- i do mostly yearly visits, give or take some months, and receive normal results on my tests. periodic imaging it taken and drusen is still, as far as anyone told me, normal and not significant. my most recent imaging and test were 2019, which as far as i am aware were normal. color vision is normal. **2020** \- testing is skipped this year for obvious reasons **early/mid july 2021 (29 years of age)** \- i start to notice in early july that the vision in my right eye seems off, but not in terms of distance. i cannot quite put my finger on what is off about it, just noted i cannot see as well. in mid-july, i realize that i am not able to see as well in my peripheral vision in the upper nasal portion. i self-test for difference in color vision between two eyes and notice that i am seeing everything in a significantly more warm/orange tone in my right eye than with my left. i call and make an appointment with a new ophthalmologist. **late july 2021** \- at the new doctor, lots of imaging is done as well as a humphrey visual field test. the images showing the optic nerve head showed ""very significant"" drusen in the right eye and only a small amount on the left. he estimated that due to how much there is, it is contributing to the loss of peripheral vision to a degree. one of the images (i don't know the name but [this is the type]( of image) showed a lumpy/bumpy appearance, which i understand to be normal with my level of drusen. it shows what looks like some fluid on the right one, which he notes but doesn't think is important. the visual field test showed a significant amount of visual field loss on the nasal side. my last visual field test from 2019 was faxed over from my previous doctor and was completely normal. due to the progression and the sudden nature of my vision loss, he referred me to a neuroophthalmologist. **late august 2021** \- i have the appointment with the neuro. more imaging is done as well as another humphrey visual field test. the imaging returns the same results, but the visual field test showed slight improvement, though my vision was still affected to a degree. my iop was 23, but my corneas are quite thick, so when adjusting for that it would have been around an 18. she did not believe that there was anything neurological going on and that it is likely loss from the drusen. she think it could potentially be from migraines and suggests an mri if i'm worried, but she doesn't think one is necessary. i decline an mri at that time because if she isn't worried, i'm not worried. we make a follow-up appointment for late november to check my visual field again and note any changes or worsening symptoms. **late august - early october 2021** \- my vision stays about the same for a week or two, but then gets significantly worse. i have tunnel vision in the right eye all day, accompanied by sharp, stabbing pain in the eye. my vision is also now blurred. i notice occasional pain/pressure in the eye as well. the next day, my vision is back to my normal. there is no clear pattern happening, but i have days where my vision is ""normal"" and other days where it's not. i almost immediately start keeping track of symptoms and activities to find any correlation. i make an appointment with me regular eye doctor just to update my prescription, as i believed it had changed and with everything else, that got put to the side at the time. in late august, i cut out caffeine and stopped taking my prescribed adderall to see if there would by any improvement in symptoms. **today** \- i go in for my normal eye exam. my prescription is exactly the same, though i mention my symptoms to him, and mentioned today was a ""good vision"" day. he decides to do more imaging, though doesn't really mention why, and takes my iop which was 22. the imaging shows a choroidal nevus in the right eye, as well as a chrpe. he mentions that with the symptoms and the fluctuations i've reported, he believes that i should go ahead and have the mri. he also says that it's possible that the nevus is leaking fluid, which can cause vision loss as well. he does not think that it is being caused by migraines as the other doc suggested. he encourages me to reach out to my neuro doc to see if she can see me any earlier than november 30th and asks that i update him if possible. i reach out via the messaging system and hear back fairly quickly. she does not think an mri is necessary, but she is willing to order one if i want. she says that it's incredibly unlikely for my nevus to be causing any issues or leaking fluid. she now believes that my vision problems are caused by a combination of ocular migraines and the drusen. she recommends i cut back on caffeine and switch to a different adhd medication. i have already completely stopped both of those things as of late august. she recommends i start keeping a log of my symptoms and recording my stress levels, caffeine intake, sleep amount and quality, and any high-sodium/high-msg, dairy, and sugar intake. i write back to let her know that i had cut out caffeine/stimulants all together, and that i had been keeping track of sleeping patterns and quality and found no correlation. i also let her know i have never had any known issues with ocular migraines in the past and asked if it was normal for them to start quite suddenly. she wrote back and mentioned that she still believes it's highly likely to be ocular migraines, and asks me to keep track of the other items as well. she said it's not unheard of for these to begin suddenly. she mentions she will still see me as scheduled on november 30th, but doesn't believe it is neurological in nature and i will likely need to follow up with my regular doc or my pcp. i reach out to my regular doc to let him know that she believes it to be due to migraines and not something neurological, and give him the updates. he says he disagree entirely, and wants me to either reach out to the other doctor in the department or get a second opinion from a different referral. (i should mention, this is not costing me anything to get the mri or see another doctor, as i've already met my deductible for the year, so both are very doable). at this point, i am really quite unclear about what's causing this or where to go from here. one doc recommends an mri, one is saying it's not needed but she'll order one if i really want her to. one is telling me it really doesn't seem like migraines, the other is telling me that's probably what it is. i'm inclined to go with whatever the neuro says, as with that being her specialty, it seems she would be more likely to know what to do. however, i am hesitant to think that this is just migraines being caused by something like msg or sugar or some other life factor that i've been exposed to my entre life when i have never had any issues like this before. i am really at a loss for what to do from here.",reddit,1,0,0.9893853,0.0106146755

9482,does a millimeter or two more of optical zone increase the overall size of the iol by very much? this is a good question. i'm not qualified to do more than guess at it though. the high power lenses (like sn60wf 29 d) already require a larger incision because of their thickness. i imagine the overall thickness centrally will continue to increase as the diameter increases. then we run into folding issues if the optic is larger. also how do you compensate for the haptics? make them smaller? they might become weaker. now you might mess with centration. this would require a whole lot of r and d and $$$ on top of the fda approval process. and it's a big risk - what if after everything there's no significant reduction in side effects? again just not worth the risk given the low incidence of complaints in the first place.,reddit,0,0,0.99992526,7.4755786e-05

9632,"hello, just a heads up, i typed a whole book below, so sorry for the length. my experience isn't one of already having had a baby, but going through the pregnancy currently. i'm hoping it will be helpful to you and that you will feel less alone... if i had to give a quick **tldr** of the below of what is helping me the most it has definitely enrolling in the research study (described in the bulleted list) and getting real about the core of my feelings and accepting the vulnerability of what means to be pregnant. **the book:** i too am pregnant with high anti-ro, (but also not diagnosed with sjogren's or any autoimmune disorder officially). i just got lucky that the autoantibodies were caught due to inflammation of my eye that they couldn't figure out, so they ran a bunch of tests and it showed up. i am now 20w5d pregnant (first time) and am in the thick of the high-risk period for someone in our situation (week 16-28 approx). while i'm doing much better now, over the summer while trying to conceive, and most of early pregnancy, i was terrified, isolated, lonely, and depressed about it. i even experienced the same feelings of self-hate that you describe. like i was an awful person for having this and it was going to harm my baby. it got to the point where my mom and husband were feeling really down because i didn't want to celebrate the pregnancy or plan or do any of the fun stuff people do when they're pregnant. i was just so focused on potential loss as if it were a guarantee... the way i was handling it before was to just constantly read everything i could - all the research articles i could get my hands on/every reddit story etc... and then just trying to suppress it/numb out during the rest of the time. but like any type of ""checking"" behavior it never really works to permanently reduce anxiety and sometimes just makes it worse. eventually i started going in a quiet room and night and meditating and then allowing the emotions to come out rather than trying to ""research my way out of the fear."" what i realized when i started quieting my mind and allowing the emotions was that i was trying to avoid getting attached to the baby because i was so terrified of the vulnerability and the pain it would cause. but the truth was, i was already attached to the baby. if something happened i was going to hurt/be devastated no matter what. i couldn't prepare my way out of the pain. something also clicked within me that the reality is, no pregnancy is fully without risk. there is always some chance something could go wrong and that doesn't stop others from enjoying and celebrating their pregnancies (not to discount the stress of knowing ahead of time that you are at a specific percentage risk for a specific issue). i also realized i was being incredibly hard on myself and blaming myself and the almost punishing myself (and everyone else around me) for the situation. i had to let go and i started to be kinder to myself about the whole thing. i also thought about how i would help my future child through fears and feelings of her own. how can i face scary things and possibly incredibly painful things? how could i live the way i would want her to be able to? i don't want to make it sound like it has all been an airy fairy /crystals and incense type experience either though, because there are some grounded practical steps i've taken to handle the stress and fears as well. 1. my rheumatologist put me on plaqunil while i was trying due to the literature showing that it quite possibly cuts the risk of heart block in half. it is my understanding this can be effective if started by 10 weeks. forewarning if you seek to be put on the medicine, you may get some push back because the studies have only been done on mothers that have already had a child with heart block, not first time mothers. my maternal fetal specialist said while they didn't think it was necessary, they considered the medicine safe and would go along with the rheumatologist. being on hcq has given me some added peace of mind. 2. i continued to see a counselor and have been able to talk with her about my fears and the pregnancy process as well as some of the darker feelings of blaming myself etc... this has been very helpful. 3. i enrolled in a research study for anti-ro positive mothers. the primary investigator of the study is one of the top researchers in this area (jill buyon out of nyu langone). the student is called stopbloq [ 1. basically they sent me an at home fetal doppler monitor and provided training videos and sample audio files of normal/abnormal heart rates. i then take a reading 3 times and day and send it over to them. if at any time something sounds out of the norm, i can text an on-call pediatric cardiologist who will review the audio file and let me know if i need to have an emergency echocardiogram. they linked me up with a research site in my state where i can go if necessary. having this added support has been an amazing blessing. 2. in summary, i hear her heartbeat 3 times a day in conjunction with the normal standard of care weekly echocardiograms at my local maternal fetal medicine specialist. hearing it before i go in makes it so much less scary... like ""oh my gosh what are they going to find this week"" type thing. 3. if you are in the usa and less than 18 weeks pregnant you may be able to enroll in the study if you are interested. there are some states without a participating site, but many states have one. 4. i got a better understanding of the reality of heart block. it is common amongst those of us with this autoantibody to know the 2%/16-20% numbers. 2% if you're a first time mom, 16-20% if your a mom who has already had a baby with heart block. but what i wasn't familiar with was... if it happens, then what. well, the fact is more babies with this type of heart block live than die. that is not to discount complications they can have nor the scary reality of the 20-30% who pass away. but it did help me to realize that the worst case scenario for a first time mom was a small percent of the already small percent if that makes sense. i really hope something in the long wall of text has been helpful for you. i know how awful and dark the feelings can be and i hope you can get some relief from them.",reddit,0,0,0.99568164,0.0043184

9660,"hi guys, thanks for any answer! i don't know where to seek help in quarantine **first,** i don't know what i have. it all started five years ago (i'm 30 now) as maybe a common problem of eye strain, everytime i read more than 20 pages of a book my eyes felt tired, if i kept reading i usually felt a weird kind of headache that tylenol couldn't fix, even if it was a lesser pain. after that i was so tired that couldn't keep reading, or playing videogames, or using my phone. at the next day, most of the time i still felt fatigued, but i could read or play and start my problem all over again. **second**, two or three years ago a new kind of problem started. sometimes, maybe once per month, little drops of blood in the white of my eyes appeared *(derrame ocular* is the name in spanish, i don't know the translation in english), along with visible veins in the white of my eyes too. they come for no reason at all, even if had a normal day without reading or focusing my vision on something. when i see my eyes like that i know i'm going to have an awful day. usually i can't do nothing when it happens, i feel worse than when i have normal eye strain, i feel an abnormal blood pressure (maybe high, i eat lemon when it happens to fix it), after a few hours my eyebags turn really dark, even the parts of my nose surrounding my eyes turn dark, and even at the next day when i feel better they keep looking like that for a while. one day i just didn't care about that blood in my eyes and kept reading, the result was so extreme that i puked, i felt like drunk, and i had to go to the hospital at 2 am!! which by the way, they didn't know what to do. **third**, i have gone to the ophtalmologist (that's the name in english? or optometrist? haha) three times for this problem. they all have given me similar prescriptions for my glasses. they were quite fast to treat me and they didn't care that much of what i said, one of them told me it was my constant use of my phone (then i forced myself to completely not use my phone for one week but i still felt pain after playing or reading), the other said it was a ""brain"" problem for the imbalance between my eyes. i don't know if that's right because i didn't felt this when i was younger, specially at university when i read all day and night. and my prescriptions haven't changed that much since i was like 22 and changed my glasses. **fourth**, i have used ocular lubricants and they make me feel better, but they just delay my problem. i have used three brands, one local brand had hypromellose and dextran, and the other two are systane ultra and systane balance. the three just give me the same result, i still feel tired, but at least i can keep living. the three can't do nothing about the problem i have when blood appears in my eyes. this is the last prescription given to me, i think i have astigmatism and hypermetropia in the left eye (which is my ""bad"" eye) ||sphere|cyl|axis| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |o.d|\+0.25|\-1.25|11<u+00b0>| |o.i|\+3.00|\-4.00|176<u+00b0>| dp: 63 i really hope anybody can help me. i'm not asking for a definitive diagnosis, i just want to know if this is normal, or if an optometrist here had experience with these problems. i really need to read, i'm a history teacher!! :( thank you all.",reddit,1,1,0.0077894675,0.9922105
9661,"your doctor seems to be of the opinion that correcting the full amount may cause you to become overcorrected and have an eye drift postoperatively. since you're 23 years old that double vision that you would get from being over corrected wouldn't be something that you would get used to or go away on its own, unless your eyes eventually started to cross back and words again. if you wear glasses then prism can be added to your glasses to help correct the double vision if you were to have it after surgery otherwise you would have to cover one eye with an eye patch. the reason you don't have double vision right now is due to a phenomenon called suppression. your right eye is the one that turns in and it was probably like that since you were a little child going by the history that you gave. when you were little and your eye started turning in you would have initially had double vision and your brain would have basically turned your right eye off to avoid the double vision. turning that eye off is called suppression and it happens in the brain. children's brains have the ability to create suppression but adults brains do not. we lose the ability to do this somewhere around the end of the first decade of life. once kids start developing suppression they can also develop what's called amblyopia, which is a reduced visiob due to inactivity of the eye caused by suppression. suppression only affects part of the eye, called a scotoma. the part of the eye that's being turned off depends on if the eye is crossing in words are drifting out words. because your eye is crossing in there is a very specific part of the eye that's being turned off. if we were to realign your eyes and over-correct you so that your eye is now drifting outward it would be a different part of your eye that would be receiving stimulus. that part of the eye was never trained to turn off and the result would be that you would have double vision.",reddit,0,0,0.9992606,0.00073939573

9669,"keeping in mind frequency is all relative. while it may look very frequent to you, it may still be infrequent enough that the doctor is comfortable watching it, and feels that binocular development is not significantly impacted. as for glasses, the issue isn't keeping glasses on a child, so much as that the doctor likely determined that glasses won't be helpful. prisms aren't always practical. some children don't respond well to programs (as in, their eye turn isn't affected by the prisms), and sometimes the size of the turn is large enough that it would require more prism than is feasible in glasses. as for angle measurements, your doctor likely took some, or at least estimated the size. infants and toddlers can be finicky, which makes getting a truly accurate angle measurement difficult. ultimately though, an angle of (for example) 25 vs 35 prism dioptres should not affect management at this stage. you asked about patching - the literature that exists on patching for intermittent exotropia is not on strict consensus. most data shows either no benefit, or modest benefit. i am not aware of any data showing negative effects in this situation. if you're not comfortable with your doctor's recommendations, there is no harm in seeking a second opinion.",reddit,0,0,0.9999083,9.166219e-05

9681,"hope i'm not too late to this - i had a reply typed out within half an hour of posting and it just... didn't post? my wifi is terrible, so not surprising. here's what i wrote: another 24 year old year with a large part of her self-identity stemming from her intellectual prowess chiming in here. i've probably had sjogren's since i was 8, and hashimoto's before that. while brain fog hasn't been my *primary* symptom or even my tertiary symptom, it has been the one i have struggled emotionally with more than any other. i'm also working on my phd in physics, and so the brain fog has impacted my work quite substantially. looking back on the tail end of my four-year undergraduate experience, what i now know as the sjogren's brain fog started to kick in. it would manifest in the form of being unable to focus on anything for more than about 5 minutes when previously i could focus on something uninterrupted for 50+min stretches. on brain fog days, i wouldn't be able to retain new information, and any work i did would either be completed agonizingly slowly (like you said, hours for a single page of information), or that work would be riddled with errors. it was incredibly frustrating for those last two years of uni, and especially my last semester when it was most frequent and i had 3 senior projects to complete. it got worse when i started my phd two years ago. everything i learned my last two years of undergrad, including the base physics i need to do any higher-level work, has evacuated my brain because of the brain fog i had during undergrad. even worse, the brain fog days became more frequent, and the brain fog itself became more intense. i ended up having to go on medical leave in november 2019 because the previous 6 months had gotten so bad. i'd been hospitalized for other symptoms off and on in october, and the brain fog rendered me quite literally unable to do any work on my research. the best i can describe it is that my vocabulary almost entirely vanished. i could barely form coherent sentences. i couldn't read, partly because i had double vision constantly, and partly because my brain would get part way through a sentence and then fizzle out so completely that my vision would go entirely white, all my thoughts would completely scatter, and sometimes, in addition to forgetting what the sentence had contained up to that point, i'd forget where i was and my own name. the same ""words go white"" phenomenon, as i was able to succinctly and ineffectually describe it to my doctors, was also prevalent when i was writing, coding, or speaking. this meant i couldn't learn new ideas. i couldn't hold concepts in my head long enough to form connections or generate ideas. i couldn't do anything that would move my phd forward. hell, i couldn't even form thoughts like ""i'm hungry"" or ""my joints are very crunchy and it hurts a lot"" or ""i need to move this spoon to my mouth so i can get enough calories to not die."" it was really bad. while the only way to address my issues this last year was through medication, something that i understand isn't in the cards for you, the meds haven't completely helped the brain fog go away. i'm *still* on medical leave (thanks, covid), but i am trying to do some light work at home, and i've found some ways to get by. like with you, trying a series of strict regimens of diets and supplements did absolutely nothing for me, and exercise only serves as a stress reducer. valuable at times, but not a complete solution. instead, in order to compensate for the sjogren's brain fog, i use skills i learned from the brain fog i've experienced with hashimoto's for the last decade. when i feel the ever-present brain fog increasing in severity, i take a series of steps: 1) i make myself a cup of tea, no matter what i was doing before. i find that the tea and the process of making it helps me calm down emotionally, and as others have stated, your own stress can be your biggest obstacle with the brain fog. while making/drinking it, i prepare for the rest of my day as will be discussed in steps 2 and 3. 2) i think about how i can change my schedule for the rest of the day to be as non-physical as possible. doing lots of physical activity when the brain fog peaks makes me less able to do anything mental, so i try to adjust what my day holds to the best of my control to prioritize the mental tasks. where can i take a bus instead of walking or driving? do i have the budget and supplies to eat pre-prepared meals instead of cooking? can i skip my band or kung fu practice this evening? 3) i think about all the tasks i have for the rest of the day and the rest of the week. is there anything immediately due tomorrow that i have to power through? if so, i move that immediately to the top of my to-do list so i can complete it before the brain fog gets too overwhelming. then, i move anything that requires learning important information or writing papers to the bottom of my list so i can tackle them when the brain fog is less bad. more minor tasks i find i have success in during brain fog are menial and repetitive tasks, like number crunching, replying to daily emails, organizing my workspace and research items, and developing soft skills. 4) once i have a handle on how i can adjust my day, i make another cup of tea and move myself into a workspace that has at least one spot of a completely bare, white wall or ceiling easily visible from where i sit. when the brain fog starts becoming overwhelming and stressful while i work, i stare at that blank spot for a while and do my best to think of nothing because the lack of stimulation it provides clears my head. this makes me less stressed and makes the brain fog temporarily less invasive. some days, staring at that spot 3 minutes out of every hour is enough to stay productive. some days, i have to space out to it for half an hour at a time to accomplish anything. on bad days, sometimes i just lay down on the floor for a bit while i veg to the blank spot on the wall. 5) i keep tea and water readily available throughout the day, as well as small snacks. when the brain fog gets bad, i've found that taking a literal minute to disengage from my work and focus on the act of eating/drinking re-energizes my brain. i've found particular success switching back and forth between green tea, lemon and ginger tea, and hard ginger candies. 6) the second emotions start to come in, the second i start feeling frustrated at my brain instead of the work, i stop. walk away. go to the bathroom. stare at a blank wall in another room. go outside and listen to birds. whatever. just physically remove myself from the frustration until i am calm again. the only way to live and have any form of productivity with constant and persistent brain fog is to not let it rule my life. to live with it as a symbiote because it never really goes away, yes, but to not bow to it. some days are better, some days are worse, and i find doing these things allow me to let my brain rest throughout the day while still feeling as though i'm productive amd proactive. i think it works because these tasks focus on clearing my head to prevent me from wallowing in the stress and depression. with sjogren's, stress is one of the biggest factors in worsening a flare. it can be tough to acknowledge the internal stress brain fog causes, and so incredibly easy to write everything off as ""if only i work harder, i'll be better."" my ability to function increases a thousandfold when i listen to my brain instead of my stress and insecurity. if my brain doesn't want to work, i don't work. i stare at a blank wall or listen to music or go for a walk or make tea, whatever feels right in the moment, and i trust my brain will tell me when it is ready to work again. it never takes my brain as long to rest and recover as the voice of fear in my head screams at me that it will. also, when the resource you depend on more than anything else for your identity and your career fails you continuously, it is hard not to experience depression. like someone said earlier, it's not a depression as we generally think of it per se because you know what's causing it, but the constant undercurrent of fear, not knowing if your brain will fail you so completely that you have to change who you are at your core and so that you'll never be able to do any of your favorite activities again, is harrowing. it's trauma. listen to your body. it knows best. in a way, i'm lucky my brain fog started at 15, because i was able to learn how to listen to my body in order to combat brain fog while in the safety net of easy classes and no bills. it's harder when you're older and there are real-life consequences. also, since you asked if people had success at dealing with brain fog and if there was any hope, let me tell you about my last semester of undergrad. my brain fog and other health issues were so bad i barely left my room, and at one point i had to get dean approval to take two weeks off. the entirety of that two week break, i laid in bed, dozing and staring at a blank wall and thinking of nothing, while star trek talked at me in the background 24/7 and my wonderful, amazing housemates brought me food and water. because i let myself rest, i succeeded in keeping top grades, earning highest honors on my cognitive science undergrad thesis and physics senior research project, getting a paper published on a project unrelated to either major, organizing and running the first ever science conference for undergrads at the united nations after 2 years of work, winning a competition to shadow the uk-nyc consul general and uk ambassador to the un for a few days, and graduating.",reddit,0,1,0.06711932,0.9328807

9734,"hi all, i've been having quite a few issues with my left eye recently. basically, when i was nine years old i accidentally stabbed myself in the left eye with a carving knife. don't ask. it was dumb. i was incredibly lucky and was told i was literally millimetres away from blinding myself. it healed fine, and i just had to use eye drops for a couple of weeks. now, flash forward to five weeks ago. i'm now 33yo and wear glasses. i have considerably worse vision in my left eye (i don't have my actual prescription to hand). five weeks ago i woke up to find that i had floaters in my left eye. a dark line at the lower left hand periphery and a horseshoe shaped floater slightly off-centre at the top of my vision. the floaters didn't disappear for three weeks, and despite google and my boyfriend telling me that floaters were a normal part of ageing, something didn't feel right. anyway (and stick with me here. i know it's getting convoluted). i went to the optician. he diagnosed me with a retinal tear and immediately sent me to a&e. the a&e doc wasn't sure whether he was seeing a retinal tear or my old injury, so he referred me to a consultant in the eye hospital. this consultant immediately diagnosed me with a retinal tear within 10 mins of looking on my eye. he even had a student doctor come in and take a look, and there was lots of talk about my ""retinal flap and how it looked like there was cigarette ash in my eye (rude). so i had laser retinopexy to fix the tear. and my vision has definitely improved. my horseshoe floater has definitely faded slightly and my dark peripheral vision seems to have come back a bit (not totally). although i'm now getting a blur across the vision in my left eye multiple times a day (not constant blurred vision). things seem to have improved though. except, when i went for my checkup yesterday, a different consultant told me he can't see any tear within my eye, but he could see a lot of inflammation in the area that i'm seeing the dark line in my peripheral vision. he had two other consultants come in to look (the word granuloma was thrown around a lot), and then he told me he thinks i have ocular toxoplasmosis. i had an oct scan, an eye ultrasound and bloods taken, and i'll apparently be seen within three days of my appointment (which was yesterday) to get the results and potentially begin treatment. but, guys, i am freaking out. the consultant was just woeful at giving me any real info on the condition, and everything i've found online is super filled with medical jargon. i just really need someone who has ocular toxoplasmosis to tell me what tf is going on. halp. tldr: i had laser eye surgery when i didn't need laser eye surgery, because i apparently don't have a retinal tear but i do have ocular toxoplasmosis. wtf.",reddit,1,1,0.0055965343,0.9944035

i thought asians are more prone to suffer from dry eyes, i once read a statistic report about that. anyway, i'll just cut my crap and share what me (and people i know with similar problems) have already found out. # diagnose ##. self diagnose first of all, you should know the current condition of your eyes. here is a very simple way to diagnose yourself. according to severity of eyes' condition, the symptoms can be categorized into 3 levels: 1. light: you can read real paper book (or newspaper, magazine, anything like that) for as long time as you want. you doesn't feel a thing while reading. but you eyes are feeling difficult while using a mobile phone or work in front of a screen monitor. 2. medium: hours of book reading make your eyes tired. not to mention screen monitors. 3. severe: even openning your eyes is difficult. you want to secrete more tears but no, there is just no tears in eyes, not if you yawn or cry. you especially hate windy weather outside, because it leads to your sore and painful eyes. guys, i'm not here to terrify you, there symptoms are what actually happened between us. and don't be desperate, i'm here to spread my experience. ## hospital diagnose you can also go to hospital, there are a bunch of machines made for this. i guess it won't costs much. in china, it costs roughly 50 dollars (chinese yuan converted to usd). with the help of machines, you'll get a report and some data about your eye condition: 1. how long can your tear film lasts each time you close and reopen your eyes? 2. what is the amount of tear you have in your eyes? 3. did you eye glands that secrete tears shrink or becoming distorted? these information is helpful, at least you need to know what happened to your eyes. sorry for the amateur description, i'm not familiar with medical terms, especially in english. # do's and don'ts ##. what to do? you can of course go to see the doctor, and often times you will have to try many doctors. in china, it seems that there is no mature way to cure dry eyes. what the eye doctor will do is let you try several kinds of eyedrops, and they often don't work well. remember, if you are using any kind of eyedrops, just make sure they are absolutely preservative free. also there are some mini-scale surgeries like smartplug and lipiflow, they are quite more expensive than eyedrops. as far as i know these surgeries are not that helpful, but you can talk with your doctors and know more. i can roughly explain most of methods eye doctors would use, how does it work and why it's not so useful etc. but let's just move on to next paragraph, because i don't really have a positive attitude toward these methods. i don't know if there are different approaches used by doctors in western countries, so don't entirely take my words before ask the doctor for help. the most valuable thing you can do is to limit your screen time. i know there are factors other than screen that cause dry eyes, yes i know, but as long as you already have dry eyes symdrom then quit using screen should improve your condition instantly. the second valuable thing is doing exercises, outdoor exercises are better. the third is sleeping enough. other things like quit masterbating or get some xanthophyll and eat fresh foods might help or might not, i don't know. three things above are proved to work well. ## don't do! 1. don't use any screen or mobile phone in a dark room! 2. don't get stick to the screen while your eyes are already shouting out loud: help! 3. don't use any eyedrops contain preservative! 4. don't try any eye surgeries before fully informed by doctors! # silver bullet is there a silver bullet, like it can cure it all? the answer is yes and no. ## yes, there is a silver bullet here comes the most important part of this post. a simple truth, what harms your eyes is the light source. it's not about the screen per se, it's the light source that lit the screen. so, if you are using kindle to read books, it should be quite comfortable for you eyes. reading e-ink paper without turning on its back light is just as reading real paper. what's the problem with iphones, laptops, screen monitors? it's the led inside the screen that harms our eyes. as far as i know there is only one another type of screen that doesn't have led: rlcd screens. rlcd screens are often used in outdoor advertisement. the problems with e-ink are the low refresh rate and limited color display. e-ink screen is just not acceptable if you are using it to work or do any kind of serious learning. what we have found out is to remove the led inside the screen monitor and use natural light as the light resource to lit the screen. it's not easy to do, but you'll get familiar after you have one or two experience dismantling it. not all screen monitors are good for this, make sure it uses a tn panel, not ips, not va, not oled, it should be tn. tn panel has better transparency. don't be scared, indoor lighting using led won't harm, as long as the light doesn't directly shot into your eyes (like while you're using screens) then it should be fine. ## no, there is no silver bullet after you remove all harmful light source from screens, your eyes should make big improvement. but are they cured? sorry, the answer is a no. for people have level 3 symptoms, you still need to rest your eyes as much as possible. i don't have a strict rule for everyone, just don't overuse it. things like sleeping and doing exercises are big pluses to your eyes, things like overusing your eyes, especially using normal led lit screens are big minuses to your eyes. increase more pluses and decrease more minuses, then you should get through this fucking tricky disease, even without using any drugs or surgeries. if your eyes just feel really dried up, you can use hylo tear drop or use a hot towel to very lightly touch you eyes. --- here we should put a period to this post, i think it's just already so long. i know there are many details i didn't expand into, so if you have any questions please leave comments below, i'll check regularly and see if i can help.",reddit,0,1,0.037310246,0.96268976
9765,"hello. my left eye sees worse than the right one and i barely see anything on computer screens without glasses. i'm using computers extensively. the thing with the left eye seeing worse is there because when i was little, i found a photo camera and played with the flash too much - it damaged my vision. if i don't use special computer glasses (expensive ones, with this violet-like glass), then my eyes get tired very quickly. it used to be so bad i couldn't look at a laptop without eye pain for more than 30 minutes. nowadays it's not so bad when i use those glasses but i have to turn down the brightness nearly to a minimum. do you think laser correction could help me with this issue with brightness? or does it just improve how far i can see? i've already done some small surgery which helped me a little bit. i can try to find my diagnosis but basically the surgery was to fix these small ""snow drops"" that i see. not sure how to explain. they had me looking at a dot and corrected my retina.",reddit,0,0,0.9997396,0.00026037678

9791,"around 3 years ago, i saw a ""flash"" in my left eye. this was on the right side of my left-eye's field of vision, about half-a-centimetre to the right from the centre of the amsler grid and, and maybe 1/4 of a centimetre down. when this calmed down a bit, it became a bit like a camera flash after-image which didn't go away, so i went to specsavers and was referred to the eye unit at a nearby hospital. they performed the full range of scans; a visual field test, something which involved laser-scanning my retina, simply looking at the problem with my eyes dilated... as i was in my mid-30s, the doctor was really trying to convince me this problem was a floater, but i was pretty sure it wasn't as the problem was ""fixed"" (it moved in perfect tandem with the movement of my eye, no drift). still, the nature of the tests they did meant they strongly believed i hadn't suffered a retinal tear or detatchment. after much examination, the doctor said they believed i was suffering from a mild form of pvd, and that i should keep aware of it and only come back if the problem got worse. they said i should avoid anything which would ""jar"" my head for a few months, so stuff like intense exercise or rollercoasters and the like, but that i should expect this as i got older, and it *should* get better over time (though could take months). it's now maybe 3 years later, and i can still see the mark in my eye. it's definitely less noticeable than it once was (like i have to drift my eye across the correct light conditions to see it, like if i drift it over the scrollbar at the edge of a computer screen) and it has become smaller, but it's still there - and it hasn't really changed since maybe a year after it first appeared. i had a scare recently where i saw another mark in the same eye, but i'm having sinus pains after a recent bout of flu and fortunately this didn't stay. still, it's made me super-conscious of this. however, when i look up pvd symptoms online, such as here...

12003,"social anxiety, hairloss and taking control of life - so here i am again, sitting in front of the computer: red eyes, tired as hell and not in the mood to do anything. it has been like this for the last few days. i have been practicing mindfulness for almost half a year now, and slowly it seemed it was starting to help with my social anxiety. sometimes i could feel ok with being physically uncomfortable. i thought i was finally going to win this battle, life wouldn't be so hard after all. but when things started to look better it happened... my hair started falling. gradually, it started to show. i take a shower and i see hairs on the drain, i pass my hand through my head and i get a few hairs on my hand. my pillow is also not a good sight. shedding everywhere... while my hairline remains exactly the same, my hair is diffused all over the top of my head. i can still look like i have a full head of hair when it's long, but i have cut it short last week and my scalp is visible under lights. i can't tell you how crappy i feel when i look in the mirror and see my scalp, such a terrible vision. i am 22 years old, this is no age to be balding... so basically i have been struggling with this. i went to a dermatologist who said i was balding and prescribed me finasteride and minoxidil. the first one can cause erectyle dysfunction, depression and other terrible things, so i wrote it off immediately. the second one is a liquid that needs to be applied twice a day to be (possibly) effective. it stimulates hair growth but it doesnt really stop the hairloss, and you have to do it forever. once you stop, you lose all the hair you gained. plus, it causes dandruff and can cause face swelling and heartbeat raising. so i really haven't made the decision to go down this route or not. i could shave my head, but it would be quite a shock and i am afraid of what it will do to my anxiety... i am not being able to cope with this. i have been binging through the internet to find information about hairloss and coping with it, but if possible i got even more lost... i tend to do this when i get down, i start searching obsessively about my situation only to find contradicting and excessive information, leading to burnout and frustration. instead of trying to distract myself and do something different, i just stay at home and ""disappear"" for a few days, avoding any plans that could take me out of my comfort zone, trying to fool myself that i am pulling myself back together and will come back stronger. i just find it so hard to take control of my life, to live in the present. i always think that tomorrow will be better and that someday, somewhere else, i will achieve my goals. but i just feel so empty right now... today i refused an invitation to a party and didn't leave the house at all. i feel once again back to square one... and it is hard to grind through these moments and to start all over again. it is hard to feel over and over again that all my progress is gone, that i am once again lonely, carrying all my fears and anxieties against the world, when all i really want is to feel surrounded by friends whom i can call and hangout whenever i want, and to find a loving girlfriend. but that just seems so distant.. any thoughts on this? anyone experiencing something similar? how do you grind through these moments? how do you build a routine and stick to it no matter what, to achieve your goals? and for anyone dealing with baldness how do you cope with it? does meditation help?",reddit,1,1,0.0037535732,0.9962464

''have you had any bad or suicidal thoughts lately? how have you been? so no changes? ok, see you next month''. it's pretty much that, i don't really have a chance to say what i want because i'm getting rushed to finish. i've mentioned smaller thing like adhd and stuff but he didn't really help me with that much. so i don't see asking for help as much of an option, i also don't want my parents to find too much out about myself because it would probably worsen our relationship more. what is there to do anymore, i don't feel like there's anything i can do now, i have no control. i don't want to keep living like this, it's so boring and my emotions have gone numb. i seriously don't want to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing i've done yesterday, i'm so sick of it... if i told my doctor any of this, he'd have to tell my parents, if my parents found out i'm depressed and suicidal and have crippling anxiety they'd treat me with even less respect than they do now, i'm considered a failure, and i agree that i am one, i just don't want them to have more reason to tell me how much i fucked up my life and how ill never have another chance in life. i already know. this has been a really sad post, sorry about that, just wanted to vent a bit. i'm usually a lot more happier sounding. thanks for reading.",reddit,1,1,0.011198711,0.98880124

(i think) because of my bad experiences with drugs i developed fear for alcohol, coffee and medicine as well. my therapist noticed it as well and at one day she said it wasnt go to work out, so they decided to let me go. after that, i became in a gap. my fears increased. i developed more fears i already had. i started to avoid more and more. taking the train and bus wasnt possible anymore. doing groceries wasnt possible anymore. especially doing it alone was becoming impossible. i managed to go with someone, but after a while that wasnt possible either. i couldnt get my hair cut anymore. i couldnt hang out with my friends anymore. i couldnt see my family anymore. all of this slowly developed in 1 year till now. at the moment i cant even open my door anymore. i still live at my moms house and i actually have no responsibilities at all. my fears are literally in everything now. i cant watch a movie, because i will fear i lose control and do something evil. im extremely alert and anxious for evil things and its ridiculous. even my hobby; making music, is affected because of it. i cant open my front door anymore, because my social anxiety feel completely overwhelming. if my mom or my sister is away and im alone i feel kinda paranoid. which is something i am fearful for that i have. i feel in constant battle with my thoughts. i am constantly afraid of losing control. that ill snap and do something incredibly stupid. im even fearful of myself. i feel like i have to be constantly alert and it actually goes automatically. im fearful of psychoses. anything that is a little trippy freaks me out. till not long ago i was taking walks everyday, but since that is gone i feel incredibly bad. i feel like i kinda lost myself. i dont who i am under this anxiety. thats freaks me out, because i dont know if its any good. im depressed out the future. i totally not feel connected with the world. physically as well(hard to explain). i just feel completely out of place. everything is just negative. constantly. because its 24/7 i wonder if this is just gad, social anxiety and depression. it makes me insecure. im afraid to expose myself outside of my home. i believe i was born more shy and thoughtful then a regular person, but if i havent go through all of this i dont think i would have suffer this much. i was afraid to sleep alone till an age of 15 for example and i still dont feel comfortable being alone. im 20 years old btw, so i probably have quite some time ahead of me.. and yeah, depressed about the future. i dont see me having a girlfriend, traveling, partying, working, going to school or just having fun in general at all anymore.",reddit,1,0,0.99988425,0.00011576193

12162,"sudden physical symptoms of anxiety. what can i do about it? - i'm 20. since i hit puberty i was always anxious and nervous around people. i would say my peak of anxiety was when i was 14. but now it's somehow getting worse with more physical symptoms. perhaps the first time it happened was when i went on a school sleepover at 15. i got a horrible stomach ache that just wouldn't go away, and i had to go home. but the frustrating thing was that within half an hour of getting back home it disappeared. maybe i was nervous because at the last sleepover i felt completely out of place and isolated while having to share my personal space with other people. i didn't get these stomach aches much for the next few years and couldn't connect them to anything particular. fast forward to 19/20, and some weird shit is happening. on the first day of my new job in the summer. over a period of an hour i got increasingly worsening cramps and nausea to the point where i had to excuse myself to the bathroom and leave my shift. i got even more nauseous in the care and when i got back home i vomited. my stomach ache stuck for the night. i didn't think much of it and thought it was food poisoning from a chicken pie i ate for breakfast that had been left out all night (in summer temperatures). but then it happened again 2 weeks later on my job. it was an extremely stressful and fast-paced day. we were the busiest we'd ever been and i just wasn't coping. i was making too many mistakes and the managers were yelling at me. again over an hour i developed bad cramping and nausea, and at the same time i excused myself and quit my job (the manager was glad). in the car i got even more nauseas. and i did not make it home. i vomited on the sidewalk. but about an hour after i came home everything levelled off and i felt fine. important to note that during that summer i was on birth control that was making me severely fatigued. so i stopped it and tried another one. so for a couple of months i've been involved in a lot of projects and been meeting a lot of people. this is after being isolated for a whole year with my childhood friends slowly dropping over the years or disbanding due to fights. this really messed with my self-esteem where i thought i was just repulsive to people. so least to say i was pretty nervous every time i tried to talk to people. i'm getting anxiety symptoms with some friends but not others. it's those friends that my strict family would disapprove of. i really try to not be nervous. i really make an effort to look forward to the occasion. in my mind i'm thinking: ""i am ready to party, i am ready to have fun. i am having fun."" but i can't help it that every single time i hang out with certain people, i shake the whole time. and then at some point, the stomach ache starts. it might decrease or increase randomly, it might get so bad to the point where i'm very uncomfortable. nausea may start. i felt the threat of vomit when we took a taxi home one time. and it always disappears when i get back home. and then, this is when shit's becoming too much. i got it at my grandparents. my freakin' grandparents. i visit them only occasionally. i don't have a good relationship with them at all, it took a nosedive over the past 3 years, plus they're getting more fragile by the month. i had noticed some visits ago how it's odd that i'm getting tremors. but this time i got nauseas and had to leave. as usual, it passed in about an hour after coming back home. it has to be anxiety. i don't think it's the birth control. i don't know what to do about it. in these situations my mind tells me i'm calm but my body says otherwise. i've been going to therapy on and off for the past 4 years. many of the professionals weren't really good, but i've stuck with the same therapist for more than a year now. so i am getting therapy. i tried an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic, and then in combination, for 6 months in total. and they did nothing. and i really don't want to go on medication because of their side-effects. i know 3 people who took anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication and it completely wrecked them.",reddit,1,1,0.008797419,0.9912026

12215,"here's a bit of advice for you: just relax. she's been your friend for 15+ years, and even though you've had a bit of distance between you and your friend, 8 months will not erase 15+ years of friendship. trust me, she will not be annoyed or upset by you texting her and you won't overwhelm her with your problems. as for the fear of sending that first message, maybe send it just before you sleep, so that you won't feel super anxious about when your friend will respond. i recommend sticking your phone far away from your bed and turning on do not disturb on it, so you don't feel tempted to check it every time that it buzzes. i'd recommend scheduled sending, but i believe the app that does this requires a paid subscription, but if you feel more comfortable with a scheduled send, then go for it. scheduling important emails to be sent out while i'm asleep has been super helpful for my anxiety (a strategy that i used this for would be my lors this week), so if you feel like sending a scheduled text helps and you are willing to pay a small fee, then go for it. as for the anxiety and fear that you feel both before and after, just know this: it's alright if your friend doesn't respond immediately. maybe they are busy or have something on the side, but know this: there is a reason you guys have been friends for 15+ years and she will respond to you, so have faith in yourself. i hope that this first text between you and your friend goes well and you guys will be able to rebuild and reconnect, and i sincerely hope that you have a great weekend!",reddit,0,0,0.9997044,0.00029556715

a lot of make up. i looked like an actual clown. i cringe about it to this day but in my 16 year old head i thought i would rather get made fun of for how much foundation i had than people seeing me turn into a tomato. so that's how my social anxiety happened. i didn't like attention, i didn't like eye contact, i didn't like interacting with anyone for fear of them judging me and witnessing an embarrassing sight. this lead me to overthink everything. i resorted to safety behaviors which meant staying home most of the time but it got bit better when i was 19 years old. my aunt had this store that she needed help running and because she spoke very limited english she pulled my ass in to help. i thought it was a one week thing but i ended up staying there for 4 years. the first year was brutal but as the years went by these interactions came a lot easier. during this time i was able to get my first job as a barista/cashier and get my drivers license. two things i never thought i would be able to do. i worked at a boba shop and it wasn't busy so it was easier to manage and the place was close by so driving there was also okay (i also have driving anxiety...). a year went by and i decided to quit and add to my resume after my cousin referred me to work as a front desk receptionist at an optometrist office. that was probably the worst decision of my life. the work environment was extremely toxic. the people that ran the office micromanaged everything, evaluated you on everything. spoke condescendingly to you and made you feel incompetent...it was hell. i wanted to quite but for my cousin's sake, i didn't want to make him look bad. i was there for about 5 months when the pandemic happened. it was a blessing in disguise for me because it meant a break from all that. i was preparing myself to go back in after a few weeks but it spanned 5 months. i knew they would call me in eventually but thought of going back scared the absolute crap out of me. i eventually got the call and after two weeks of being there i put in my two weeks notice because just as i expected, i couldn't handle it. before, i was able to put up a front and tell my self to stop being a little bitch and to do what i was told to do and leave. not the best coping mechanism but it's what got me through. now, i was now holding back tears in the break room and crying while driving home after every shift. i quit and i focused on school which was still all held online at the time. i couldn't even do an online presentation for one my classes because of how bad my anxiety got. it didn't even require me to turn on the camera, just audio and i couldn't do it. the pandemic that i thought was a blessing in disguise turned out to be the opposite. i feel like from 19-22 i made progress and now i'm back at where i started but this time older and more expectations and pressure from family and society now that i graduated. i also forgot to mention that i dropped two toxic friends along the way. i only have one friend now but we have our issues too. she's understanding and i share a lot with her but...i don't get that closeness like i did with the other two friends. it's weird. i feel alone and i want to make more friends but making friends as an adult is rough and it's even harder when you don't go out and think everyone hates you lol. i actually went to see a psychiatrist yesterday because it was getting a bit much for me. a lot of ruminating thoughts and a lot of questions like, ""how the hell am i expected to live a decent life if i can't do simple things like x, y, and z?"" fear turned into anger and i really don't want to keep living like this anymore. i graduated and i need to get on with life. i need to either find a job or go back to school to pursue higher education. i haven't decided on either yet but the main thing holding me back is my social anxiety. my psychiatrist told me that exposure therapy is what i need to do. i need to embrace that rush i get and become conditioned to get use to doing things like driving, talking to people, doing things by myself, etc. i was also prescribed lexapro, and propranolol. i haven't picked them up yet but he said that these are here to hopefully help kickstart my journey but everything else is willpower and motivation. i can't say i have any of that right now but sharing all of this does help a bit.. if you got through all that, thank you. if not, i understand because this is extremely long lol. anyways, if anyone is like me and needs an online friend i'm here! my main hobbies and interests include kpop and cooking :) \~ i also have a kpop twt account if you feel more comfortable talking there\~",reddit,1,1,0.005070596,0.99492943

12255,"first of all, i'm really impressed by how aware and reflective you are about your own feelings and behaviors, as well as how you're trying to continually work on yourself. i've struggled with depression all my life and social anxiety for about 15 years, and it's often felt like i can't do anything to change it -- i mean, often i can't when episodes are at their peak. however, i've learned various triggers and ways of controlling things that do influence my depression and anxieties. and a lot takes practice and patience. i think you clearly are practicing and seem to have a lot of patience. what i would be worried about is thinking of it in terms of molding yourself to become a ""better"", ""less awkward"", ""normal"" person, as opposed to keeping your ""creepy shell"" on. while it can be good to try to learn to adjust your behaviors and how you express yourself in order to come across as more socially adept and not as awkward, stressing this too heavily might lead to self-judgment about things you don't need to judge yourself for, like (1) things you do that are awkward in themselves and not because of you or (2) things that aren't awkward for other people but that you feel are awkward. as an example of (1), often times co-workers (who are not independently great friends) will feel pressure to make small talk when they first come into the office. this is often awkward for a lot of people. i, for one, find small talk really awkward, and in these contexts i've tended to be excessively focused on my own expressions of my feeling awkwardness -- which in turn leads me to behave outwardly even more awkwardly. i have tried in the past to make myself more sociable and take control of the conversation, and found some success at times; but honestly, i find myself less capable of doing this when my depression and anxieties are significantly high. something i found that works better for me is to learn to be comfortable with this kind of awkwardness. it takes a lot of patience, but i've been feeling less anxiety in these situations. that office small talk example could work as an example of (2) as well, because i've become friends with some people who i work with who eventually tell me that i wasn't awkward at all -- even though i distinctly remember it *feeling awkward and behaving obviously awkward*. a lot of the things you mention in your first list seem to be things that are just inherently, or very often, awkward for all parties involved. flirting with someone is awkward for most, i'm pretty sure (it is for me!); getting rejected is as well (fuck me ded); being in a conversation where someone leaves you on read is awkward (dear god, it's me...); etc. i think it's okay to feel awkward in these situations. if it's important to you to flirt with your crush, not let rejection get you down, etc., i think one big part of it will be learning to be more comfortable in these awkward situations. i like your example of flirting and then feeling like you made the conversation uncomfortable and then opening up about that. i think the most neutral response would be not to mention the feeling that the convo is now uncomfortable, but it seems that it's an important feeling you have atm. it's good that you notice it, but also it doesn't seem to bad to even express that to someone or to add the disclaimer that you tend to overthink these things. that kind of ""word vomit"" is genuine and honest and, imo, not awkward. those who say it's awkward probably have in mind a person who is not gaston and not overly confident about everything. tl;dr: the point i'm taking way too long to make is that trying to inhibit your dispositions to express your anxieties or feeling of awkwardness is sometimes unnecessary (because the awkwardness is due to the situation) and potentially quite unhealthy (because you may end up feeling terrible for not successfully inhibiting all of those dispositions). moreover, although you can definitely find success at modualting the way you express your feelings and thoughts in general, i'm a firm believer in the idea that mental states like depression and anxiety are very robust and will find a way to express themselves. so just inhibiting them can potentially create a bunch of pain. it all depends on the full story of you, but it's something you should keep in mind. so, sure, try and learn to feel *okay* when someone leaves you on read -- that may help you in similar situations in the future (like emotional weigh lifting!) -- but also be sure to attend to your feelings and how bad it would feel to keep them in vs. how good it would feel to let them out organically.",reddit,0,0,0.98689085,0.013109151

12314,"how much does environment affect your anxiety? - for the past couple of years i haven't been happy. i've spent numerous hours just thinking and pondering and wondering why i no longer feel enlivened the way i used to, many years ago. i'm 21 years old and i'm at a stage in my life where i'm starting to question the meaning of my existence. i've given it a lot of thought and come to the conclusion that maybe it's the place in which i reside that is the source of my mood swings and anxiety. i was born in toronto and am a visible minority. for anyone who has knowledge about the city, it's extremely diverse and teeming with all sorts of ethnic cultures. when i was only 2 years old, my parents, who had lived in the city for almost their entire lives, decided to pack up and move to a little industrial city on the south shore of lake ontario known as st. catharines. i have spent the following years there ever since. toronto is where i feel i belong, and i will elaborate on that below. most of my extended relatives live in toronto. my family had work/personal ties to people living there, and for whatever reason it feels like they were happier living there too. i won't get into all the details but i'm mixed race and visibly appear to be of the visible minority side (half white, half visible minority). st. catharines is a city primarily composed of aging, white, blue collar workers, and there seems to be an air of hopelessness in the city. several years ago, a lot of the larger auto manufacturing plants here closed down when the whole nafta trade agreement came into play, costing people a lot of their jobs. as a result, there are a lot of people here on welfare or barely scraping by, which sort of lends this whole depressing atmosphere to the region. the suicide rate is also one of highest in the country, so i'm apparently not the only one who thinks the whole place is kind of a shit-show. jobs aren't really a thing here either, well, unless you would like to work retail or customer service call centre type jobs for the rest of your life. there's not much of a future here, a lot of the younger folk straight up move away because of the severe lack of good paying jobs. i had the opportunity to move back to toronto a few years ago now and refused to take the opportunity for fear of accruing too much student debt. i've been kicking myself ever since, but that now begs the question: how much does environment really affect one's mood? i'm not talking about personal relationships or how many friends one has, although that also plays a part in all this. i'm talking about demographics and small city living vs urban big city habitation. i enjoy the big city; every time i go back it just feels like home, even though i haven't lived there for most of my life. i feel like i'm missing out on all the action when i stay here, instead of experiencing the vibrancy and liveliness of a larger city. part of it is just the fact that i feel alienated somewhat since i don't fit in with the rest of the population here. people here can be sort of naive, and it doesn't help that the local university has a large international student population that i get lumped into simply because of how i look. it kinda sucks when people don't really think you're a born and bred canadian. so, with all that being said, i think that while moving back to toronto may not cure my anxiety entirely, it would certainly help a lot with my fear of people and interactions, and my unwillingness to go outside (and there's not much to do here anyway) with the exception of going to work/school. it may be expensive, but i feel like it would provide a large boost in quality of life, something i so desperately need at this point. i'm young, i should be out there experiencing new things and learning new ideas. i guess i just have to get over this fear of financially digging myself into an inescapable hole. the anonymity of a big city... it's attractive to me. am i alone in my situation? i'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter. after all, that is why i'm making this post.",reddit,1,1,0.0035079445,0.9964921

12331,"i think we can approach some of these from a different angle: &gt; hiking - the most plausible, but i could definitely see a ""clique"" of like six people talking to each other and ignoring the ""new guy."" plus, there are like **3,000 members** and most of these groups have waiting lists. i also hate traveling and being stuck in a car for hours while struggling with my gps and praying that i don't get lost, so a group that meets in radically different places literally all over the state every few weeks sounds like a nightmare to me. i feel like 3000+ members = lots of different types of people to meet, and i would say is worth the risk given your situation. &gt; movies - how can you make friends in a movie theater? lol it's true, that most film groups will be gungho about films and will not likely talk during the screening. however, once it's done there's lots of interesting aspects about the film that can be discussed. plus if you meet someone with similiar taste in movies, it's a great common ground to start a friendship on. &gt; soccer - i'm a scrawny dude with no athletic ability whatsoever. don't feel like failing to keep up with everyone else and making a fool of myself. i feel you here, i used to be terribly out of shape. i had finally joined a kickball team after much nagging from a friend (whom i had met at a film thing). it was great, everyone was older (20+) and it didn't have the same pressure of hs gym class. it's awesome to be surrounded by other people who are comfortable with themselves, i think it just comes with age &gt; photography and cycling would be more my speed, but they seem kinda... solitary? how do you make friends while riding a bike? plus, i live on the third floor of an apartment building and i don't have anywhere to put a bike, nor do i know of any nearby trails. again, i don't feel like driving for an hour and risking getting lost just to ride a bike and then have to lug it around with me when i get back to my apartment. yes, i would agree that it is solitary. but with the club you can discuss techniques. if the group shoots film you can do darkroom photo development together. one of the best ice breakers in nyc was going upto random strangers and asking for their photo. people love getting their pictures taken (as you may have noticed on social media). i had only been declined once, and it wasn't embarassingbad at all i would get an indoor bike rack where you can stand your bike or hang it on a wall. again, i would say it's worth the risk. if you get really invested into biking, you can get some sweet bikes weighing in under 20. i would say fast riding can be isolating, but you take breaks together, and rides can be casual as well. typing this reply to you really hits home for me. i used to have a feeling of fomo (fear of missing out), but i would tell myself some excuse not to get outside of my comfort zone. it's a hard leap especially if it turns out bad, but wouldn't you agree that something should change if you want a change in your life?",reddit,0,0,0.9998791,0.00012082441

""you always act like you are embarrassed by me. like i'm a failure in your eyes."" no matter how much i open up to my mom about my issues she does this stuff or just tells me to get over it. i value her thought so much because my father just has always looked at me like a failure. when anyone criticizes me i feel like i can't do anything right. no wonder why i dont like going places.",reddit,1,0,0.9984281,0.0015719368

12500,"finally talking to my doctor about anxiety today - advice? - i have a doctors appointment this afternoon and i'm going to bring up my anxiety in hopes of maybe getting medication. a little backstory: i've struggled with both social and general anxiety for as long as i can remember...for most of my life i never even knew what anxiety was. i'm 25 now, and back in school they never taught us about mental health, they kinda touched on it, but i always thought the term ""anxiety"" just meant temporary nervousness. i thought i was a nervous person my whole life, then i discovered anxiety near the end of high school, early college. i still haven't gotten help though, but i'm really struggling as the anxiety interferes with my everyday life, my work, my relationships, it holds me back so much. i get irritable, overly stressed, worry about every little tiny problem, and on the physical side i get shaky, i stutter, my throat gets tight, my face turns red and hot, heart rate increases, and if it's really bad i cry and can't speak. anyone who's talked to their doctor about this, can you give me some advice or share your experience? i guess i'm just worried the doctor won't believe me? it seems like everyone has anxiety these days, it's almost like a trend to say you have anxiety and depression so i don't want mine to be written off. i rarely go to the doctor to begin with so i'm not sure how to start this conversation. i don't want it to sound like i'm desperate begging for meds or something, i just need some relief. another reason i've avoided this is because i'm a little hesitant to go on meds, i know they can mess with a lot of people and i don't want to become totally dependent...another thing to worry about lol (thanks anxiety). i also know therapy is super helpful too, but it's honestly something i can't afford right now, my insurance doesn't cover much. i want to get into therapy in the next year if possible but it's not an option at the moment. so i'd appreciate anyone's insight on this and how i can go about talking about anxiety with my doctor. thanks.",reddit,1,1,0.005179384,0.9948206

12575,"social anxiety is ruining my life - i've always had problems talking to people and forming interpersonal relationships, but it's now at a point where it's safe to say that it is ruining my life. i only have two people that i somewhat regularly talk to, because they're friends from all the way back in elementary school. my family life is fucked, i live alone in a small apartment and talk to them only very occasionally. the only person from my family that i have a deeper connection with is my twin sister, who however has moved to the other side of the country, so i only see her very rarely. even she doesn't know of the full extent of my anxiety and depression, i think she just thinks that's just who i am. i just turned 21 now and i'm about to finish up an internship at an it company, that i luckily got not because of my social skills, but because i was top of my class and they offered it to me because of that. just like with every other job/school i've been to before though, i talk to no one unless it's absolutely necessary and i have to do it because of the job. i feel uncomfortable and don't feel like i can relate to anyone there, even though they're not bad people or anything. now my supervisor came up to me last friday and told me that while i do my job well, i won't be able to get a full time position after the internship (which was the mutual plan from the start) because of my lacking social skills and me not talking to anyone. this honestly didn't surprise me that much, but it still hit me like a brick. i was trying to hold back tears and felt completely dumbstruck for the rest of the day, not because i want the job so desperately, but because this is the nail in the coffin in my realization that my social anxiety is absolutely ruining my life. i am dealing with depression because of how miserable my life is and because of how terrible it feels to miss out on life. life is passing me by and i watch every year go by with minimal change. i've never even kissed a girl, i spend most of my time playing computer games or browsing the internet, because i have nothing else to do. the thought of engaging in social activity, let alone go to parties or something, ignites instant panic in me. the thing is that my supervisor offered to give me one last chance to better my social behavior in the remaining 1.5 months of my internship. he's surprisingly nice considering that most people usually write off my social anxiety as ignorance, and i don't hold a grudge against him for not wanting to employ me, i honestly probably wouldn't employ myself either. he recommended me to join an acting club because he believes that would help, but honestly that just made me panic and i can't even see myself doing something like this. i think i literally couldn't do it. he said i should think about it over the weekend. so what do i do? i can't see myself joining an acting club, the thought of that alone frightens me and i think i would only leave even more retreated in my shell. but if i say no that would show them that i'm not trying to better myself. the thought of seeing a therapist sounds more promising to me, there would be less pressure and i could try to figure myself out as to why i am like this. i definitely think it has to do with past experiences in my life, i developed trust issues from an abusive mother that might have developed into me not being able to get personal with anybody. then again i started questioning if it might be better if i don't even try to stay at that company after the internship. people there, while nice, already have the impression of me being a freak, and the longer i know people the harder it is to be myself around them after all this time. i might need a fresh start or just some time off for myself to really self reflect and get a handle on things. i just want to start living and stop this endless cycle of mundane existence. regardless, tomorrow i have to tell my supervisor what i have envisioned for the future, and i still don't know. any advice is appreciated, especially if you've been or are still going through the same things. thanks.",reddit,1,1,0.005543723,0.9944563

12598,"i have no friends and i feel lonely - * post is going to be long and thank you to anyone who actually reads all of it okay so im 19f and i have no friends. in high school i had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her bff, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people i talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. so my bff and i were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. we would still talk and i was her best friend but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. i ended up confessing to one of the other girls i was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. my bff and i ended up talking everything through and were good but things didnt really change. she kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when i did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. after we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. she spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. during this time i was at my dads house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that i was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didnt. summer goes along and we didnt talk not even once. at this point in my life i had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because i felt that i needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. the entire summer we barely hung out. after summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. im personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when im around people i feel comfortable with. they would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. i dont mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. when i would ask one of them about the boys in the college i was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. then in october i got a job, and i really like the place i work at. when we would hang out and i would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didnt care and i would talk and they didnt respond and i felt like i was talking to my self. all of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldnt include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when i was there made me feel really lonely and tired. eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when i texted them i was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like oooohhh cant wait for the tea or , the tea it hot and in general things like that. i was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected i was from the situation between my bff and i all they cared about was the tea and the drama. a month after this happened i cut them off but only talked to one of them. it was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. i thanked her for supporting and that i was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and i explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and i never texted her again. both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and i have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. i started college but online bc i have no transportation to campus so i have no interactions with people my own age and at my job its mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone i consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. it gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when i wish i was doing that. plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their squad makes me depressed! because i want that. now because of my friendless life and because i have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year im beyond scared to do school on campus so ive decided to do all of college online. ive definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. ive never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation im never going to meet one and if i do, i mentally ive already sabotaged myself because i think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that i have none. like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. so to avoid this im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. plus im insecure about my body bc im a little chubby but dont do anything to change this because i have zero motivation. so far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. i get depressed when i think about the fact that im so young and i have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. like am i really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. sometimes i think that the best i can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company i work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever. sorry for this long ass stupid rant. goodbye im sad as fuck now low key crying and depressed:))))",reddit,1,1,0.0054625557,0.9945374

12609,"can anyone please help me? - i am a 17 year old girl. i have so much insecurities about my looks for example my skin, forhead, nose, lips etc... it started with my nose that i hated since i was a child that i would cry because i didn't like it. but in recent years since i started high-school my insecurities increased. when i was 14 years old i remember sitting in my bed and crying because of my nose, and my imperfect skin. so months later i started living in a fantasy world where all my insecurities were fixed, my nose was smaller, skin tone was even, my hair was thicker and healthier etc. at first it was something i did once in a while but then it increased it became almost an addiction. i would spend hours everyday where i close the lights in the room lower the temperature, lock my door and play really loud music while i pace around my room, escaping into my fantasy world. i feel so amazing when i daydream it feels so real for me. the problem is that now my insecurities increased, especially that i can detach from my body so easily. i don't look in the mirror for days, i sometimes can't shower for a whole week not because i am dirty but because i don't like the fact that my skin tone is not the same everywhere and because it is not perfect. i can't study well because whenever i try to come to real life i feel so sad because i feel like i am crazy for living in a fantasy world i feel so bad and so much regret and this makes me want to escape life again. but this had also made me lose my concentration and i literally don't remember anything at all. i don't even know what i am saying, i forget things that i did in the past and where i placed stuff etc. if u can see how messy this post is it is literally how my brain works another problems is that i literally keep remembering the bad things that happened to me all the time when i am in the real world i believe that i have two faces my pretty face and my ugly face my pretty face is skinnier and with a smaller nose etc.. i feel when my face is the pretty one so i can look in the mirror and can be more productive and confident. but when i have my not pretty face i feel so down and i can't do anything, i can't go out in public, i sometimes cancel going out or feel so nervous and scared. i once was so nervous to go to a party that i started crying in the car. i am so sure about the pretty face thing because even my father noticed and he told me that my face looks different during not pretty face period and during my pretty face period after days later he told me that my face got smaller. i try to fake it and act normal when i am with others so no one knows that i suffer every single second of my life. especially that i go out during my pretty face times so i am more confident and they don't notice. i am determined to have a nose job, i even chose my surgeon. i feel like i will be happier after my nose job. i hate cameras so much, i don't like taking pictures and videos or look at old photos at all. i rarely take selfie and they are mostly through specific angles. i don't like opening cameras in online classes, and if i had cameras open i feel so nervous and my heart keeps beating for the whole class. i hate going out because of cameras. i feel so embarrassed by my daydreams but to be honest they make me happy. my fantasy world reached a point where i would lie about things that happened to me in real life but they actually haven't. i sometimes believe what happens in my dream world. i am literally addicted to my fantasy world i am even scared to show my face in public, especially after the masks thing nowadays i don't have this as much thankfully but last year for many many months i had sleep paralysis and nightmares almost every night. i can only look in the mirror if i pinched my nose every few seconds to make it look smaller. i have only seen my nose unpinched only 2 times maybe in the past years. i know it is terrible but i really don't like my natural nose. i also have to smile a certain way because i don't like the way my lips look when i have a straight face. looking in the mirror has so much rituals for me. i also don't like my feet and that is why i wear socks all day so that not me or anyone can see them. i also don't like real life because i feel so alone and scared, unlike in my fantasy world. i sometimes feel suicidal and have urges to cut, i brought a knife and placed it in my wrist multiple times but i thankfully didn't actually cut, i also feel like if i started cutting it will make marks in my skin and people would know aswell as ruin my skin and make me even more insecure about it. my fantasy world seems so real to the point that i once cried so bad when one of the people in my world died. i love my characters so much, because they actually help me, unlike in real life where i don't have anyone to tell. i am about 100lbs and people tell me that i am skinny but i rarely see myself as so. i know that i am skinny but i don't feel it. i don't believe i have an eating disorder because my whole diet consists of sodas and sugars and i don't really care as much. i don't like salads and vegetables and i rarely cook because it also puts me.in real life i keep getting these moments when i feel so nervous and scared for no reason and start to cry. i have no idea why i had tried to meditate and pray but i can't for many days because it makes me go into reality and it feels scary for me. i get intrusive thoughts about my looks all the time. like for example my brain tells me that i will never be pretty enough. and when i see models my brain tells me that i will never be like them. i am tearing up now and i honestly didn't tell anyone about this, i told my parents that i needed therapy but they won't let me go to because they don't think there is anything wrong with me. also both my parents are doctors and my mom would tell me (since i was young) that if i had any problems i should tell her. i do tell her about almost everything except this thing because it's embarrassing and she also has her own problems so i don't want to worry her. i dont want to self diagnose but i can't go to a psychiatric or psychologist, so does anyone know what should i do. i really want to become better but i am scared i don't care about my looks for other people but mostly to myself because i know that most people are not perfect and i honestly don't understand how they are ok about this, i feel like i should be perfect in every aspect, looks, education, clothing etc..",reddit,1,1,0.004471491,0.9955285

""it's not rocket science"". at this point i feel like the biggest idiot on the planet. i want to crawl into a hole and pull it in after me, but we still have work to do. i make another mistake while we finish up with the same results, i clock out and walk to my car as fast as i can without standing out. it's been a few hours since i clocked out, and the whole time i have felt an intense feeling of shame. it won't leave me alone and its about all i can do to keep myself from breaking out into tears. i've tried to distract myself, i've tried to meditate, i've tried just letting myself feel the emotion. no matter what i do i can't let it go, it's like a stink that i can't seem to wash off. my mind keeps wandering back to the events of the day. the words said to me play again and again like a broken record. when i go to sleep, i'm willing to bet it's going to follow me into my dreams. i just want to put it past me, but the worst part is that i'll probably have to work with those guys again. the thought fills me with horrible dread. &amp;; have any of you had similar feelings and experiences? how do you deal with them? i could really use some advice, or maybe just encouragement. i'm trying my level best to drag my life out of the pit it was in, but i feel like i'm hitting a wall.",reddit,1,1,0.0053264173,0.99467367

(she convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. which, it was, but not all like she thought. this was also good advice from her point of view because i had a lot in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. so leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) i was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me i stop loving her. she deserved someone better, so i made that choice for her. i wanted to be better. i wanted to be someone she deserved. so i started trying to be a person. i went and got a real hairstyle (i use to just use clippers and do it myself.) i started running/biking again. (i have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) i got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. i went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and i just wore running/work out attire. i enrolled in school, which is something i stopped when i went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. in school i started strong, i was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so i could get connections for an internship. then my anxiety hit me, hard. i couldn't finish my resume because i am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. i lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. that caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. my 4 a's fell to near f's and i was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate i knew from an old job and rounded my grades to c's before the end. even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. nothing changed. no one cared. i ended things last november with her. i was motivated to better myself until april. i went to the gym every other day, i ate healthy, i wasn't excited to be back in school, but i did it and took pride in doing so. but the pride in myself diminished to nothing. i still had no one to go have fun with. no one texted how i was doing. i even stopped getting likes/conversations on tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. i am lonelier more than ever, and i have been without close people most of my life. i use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. or teach people english (which is something that brought me joy.) now the only connection i feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes i get on something. i use to be a lurker and only send messages when i saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. i would just tell them i would be here to listen for the former case and that i appreciate them if it were the latter. i use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. it is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. since april i have basically laid in bed. i still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. i browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. i don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy i am. i don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if i am really fooling people. i don't want to be a burden so i don't talk about anything. when my brother's girlfriend asked why i wasn't leaving for classes i told her i missed the deadline to enroll because i was depressed a friend of mine passed away. really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. i would have loved to be friends with her. she was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. i was especially torn up about losing someone that i use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. she was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, i wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. why couldn't the world have taken me instead? i can't find any strength in myself. i don't know what to do.",reddit,1,1,0.40535632,0.59464365

(they saw my shoes in front of my door but they didn't knock on door. i don't know what they think about me, what makes me feel little anxious, but they don't have a need to start conversation with me, neither). even if i would be probably glad for tips how to fix this, i'm not sure if i would be able to realise it. i can say to myself 'do this, do that' but do it is sometimes really hard and i just give up and let anxiety win. thanks for read this and sorry for my imperfect english. i'm curious if tomorrow i will be able to say them something more than hi/hello.",reddit,1,1,0.0077587334,0.99224126

""shes pretty, am i appealing enough to talk to her? "" or comparisons to bigger, more attractive men. these thoughts would circulate my brain until i fall asleep. however i feel like im capable of so much more if i had the confidence. im an outgoing person with some heavy self loathing and anxiety. if i didnt feel like killing myself or anxious solely from the thought of thinking that everyone around me is better than me, or that im actually an awkward dumb, unaware loser that people pity laugh at. a forced chuckle or display of kindness when in actuality they think im just extremely weird. 20 yrs. and im still trying to find comfort with being myself. its been a long long journey and i feel like ive made a lot of progress. my maturity has helped to soothe an overactive mind. sorry, i feel like my explanations for my thoughts are messy and all over the place. anxiety and add makes a fucking killer combo. like a combo that makes me want to gouge my eyes out whenever the sinking, pumping, spiking feeling that occurs in my chest that resonates throughout my body that flares out to my limbs, then seeps into my psyche. sorry i feel like this post is just a huge rant now, my original intention was to see if i could be able to converse or relate with similair people thats experiencing what im feeling. i dont want to die man. i dont want to fucking die i just want to feel ok. im trying to draw out the will inside me to pursue the lost confidence hidden inside me. i broke down the other day thinking about how old my parents have gotten. and how genuinely excited they are when they visit or when i visit them. these recent years have been really rough and my entire family has been losing it. ive felt distant and lethargic and wasted years of my life acting out in order to fill the self degrading thought hole that has developed inside me. and have you ever had a situation where someone says that i cant talk to them because youre too much? youre too negative you should stop talking about it so often. or when you do talk about it and you feel like you bring it up too much to your friends and they all think youre annoying. another thing that happens to me is that whenever i get a gf, i always get extremely close because if i fall in love with you, or if i feel and acknowledge the love thats being given to me, i become entirely comfortable being myself. or at least much better compared to just a friend. but then i get too attached because that person is the only person i would feel comfortable with being myself, and since thats the case ill always go to them whenever i feel like killing myself or having an anxious episode because i dont want to or dont feel capable of going to another person other than them. i try to avoid it. im trying so hard man, to just exist. to be productive. i feel like i have barely gotten anything done for the last couple years because im too wrapped up in my head. the more soothing thing to do is to do something other than my priorities because the amount of things that i need to overwhelms me and i end up doing nothing. every single time. ive written : "" transfer photos out of phone"" ""finish the song youre making"" ""start learning how to edit"" "" develop a certain skill slowly throughout the month or year these are a few goals that ive written in my notes a million times its been years and i stll havent been able to transfer some photos out of my phone and snapchat as well. what the fuck is wrong with me &amp;; &amp;; is what i would think to myself. i want to conclude this rant saying that ive proggressed a lot. i was able to reach a point where ive felt no desire to kill myself during this last winter. it was astounding. i reached a point where ive never felt so comfortable about myself in my life. despite me feeling like ive relapsed back into toxic habits and thoughts, my drive to get better has always stayed with me. sorry if this is a tldr post. but i really needed to rant in some type of way you know? to conclude i wanna share some tips; tips from an experienced anxious guy look up cbt, learn breathing exercises !! when bad thoughts happen try to imagine that thought drifting past you as a cloud, my anxiety improves whenever i had periods of time that i had a eureka moment, trying to get my life together by eating right and sleeping better. that will automatically transfer to improvement in your social life!! learn to love yourself. whenever you feel like youre extremely alone.. if youre able to read this, join groups online! or join a dischord. post things anonymously to feel some type of connection. youre not abnormal for feeling the way you do , youre not a loser if you feel alone , youre not a failure, youre not",reddit,1,1,0.013008857,0.9869911

13000,"seeing this girl - hey guys. im pretty sure that i have social anxiety. started realizing it around 8th grade, when i started dating a girl from my class. i was never the one who made moves, i was too nervous and insecure. my lips get dry, my hands starts shaking and gets sweaty. it was horrible because i was so attracted to her, but i just couldnt show it/turn it into action. this made me stay away from dating until a couple of years ago. ive met with like 3 girls from tinder since then. a couple of days ago i went for a walk with this really cute girl, and even though i was very nervous at first, it got better along the way. she wants to see me again which im really happy for, but im also a bit scared honestly. im 23 now, still a virgin and havent really kissed a girl before. ive had offers before, but i just never had the courage to do anything about it. im afraid that my lack of experience is going to ruin it for me. i know that she has been in a longer relationship before, so i think my lack of experience will be pretty obvious to her. we grew up in the same small village and know most of each others friends to some extend, which just makes it even more scary. anyone of you with similar stories or advice on how to deal with this issue? would love to hear what you think.",reddit,1,1,0.0034647733,0.9965352

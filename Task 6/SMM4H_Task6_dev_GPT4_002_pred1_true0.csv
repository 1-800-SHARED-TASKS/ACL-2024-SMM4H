8851,"here is my story. extremely farsighted as a kid (early 60's) and in glasses. diagnosed with kc in 1968 and 1970, age 14 and 16. eye check at school sent me to an optometrist who sent me to an ophthalmologist. all they had back then was rgp lenses. no such thing as cxl or sclearals. graduated high school, college and got half a masters degree with rgp's. had cornea transplants in 1980 and 1982. cataract surgery 1998 and 1999. one was not successful. the lens implant came out of the capsule and was floating on my retina. i then had a vitrectomy to remove the lens and put another one in. this surgery caused strabismus and over the period of a year had 4 occlunum injections into the eye muscle. after all of this, my corneal grafts made it through just fine. i have been in glasses ever since. i retired from my occupation in 2012 and am living a normal life. all i have to do is put my glasses on just like a normal person saw my doctor on the 13th. my 38 and 40 year old grafts are still clear healthy and i am seeing 20/25 and20/40 in glasses. next dr apt scheduled in a year. no, my case is not usual and grafts this old are not normal. yes, all our experiences are not the same. hope you do as well as i.",reddit,0,1
8858,"hi, all. i am looking for advice on what specifically to request in my glasses lenses from the optician at my eye doctor's office (independent practice, not a chain or online) and advice on the frame itself. if it matters, i have worn contacts for the last 25+ years and will be getting an updated prescription on those as well. my glasses prescription is around a -13.00 in both eyes. i'm nearing 40 and my prescription is stable, so i'm willing to pay more for thinner lenses, but aside from requesting the high index 1.74, i have no idea what other things to mention or ask of the optician. i have looked online quite a bit, but have become overwhelmed and confused with all the terminology and contradicting articles. regarding the frame itself, i am currently wearing a frame size 49-17-135. the lens height is around 28. my face is a bit round, so to offset that i have chosen a rectangular shape frame in the past, but realize now this is contributing to the thickness of my lenses. also, when i smile, my cheeks tend to touch (due to roundness) the bottom of frames with a taller lens height, which the shorter lens of the rectangular frame also prevents. if i were to opt for an oval lens, would the lenses be substantially thicker than if i were to get a round lens? any advice or insight you could provide so that i may be better informed prior to my appointment would be very helpful. i will certainly be asking for the opinion of the optician, but, while i have great faith in my opthalmologist, i'm not as confident in the optician's knowledge or desire to help. thank you!",reddit,0,1

9121,"yes, you do have to insert and remove your contact lenses every day. it is tricky at first but most people get pretty good at it within a few weeks. they shouldn't be uncomfortable if they fit well. but getting a good fit can be a challenge for kc patients. you want to find the best fitter you can. you need someone with the experience and the patience needed to fit kc patients. because kc is rather rare, only a few contact lens fitters become good kc lens fitters. some doctors are better than others at prescribing glasses for kc patients. i have had kc for over 50 years. when i was first diagnosed, kc lenses and fitting technology was primitive compared to today. i wore glasses for many years because they couldn't find comfortable contact lenses for me. when i found someone who had the knack for prescribing glasses for me, i stuck with them until they retired. here are a few ideas that might help with helping your doctor find a good glasses prescription. the critical part of the exam is the subjective refraction with the phoropter. this is where you look through the funky ""glasses"" and select ""which is better, 1 or 2?"" remember, it is the prescription that is being tested, not you. you are the grader. don't strain or use tricks to try to see better. just try to give each lens prescription presented to you an honest review based on the way you'd want to see through your glasses. rather than trying to decide which image is better, something that has less meaning for someone with kc, try selecting the image you prefer. if both are bad, maybe in different ways, just say so. same if both images are ok and you don't have a preference. if you can describe what makes the images bad, that may help your doctor. if you have a good rapport with your doctor, which is really helpful for kc patients, you might pass on these tips: ""use 0.50ds steps or more when assessing sphere and cyl. it is often easier to assess the cyl before finalizing sphere correction, as large amounts of uncorrected astigmatism cause excessive ghosting."" that is advice for fitting kerasoft contact lenses, but it would apply to any subjective refraction of a kc patient. what makes prescribing glasses tricky for kc patients is that you can't just methodically zero in on a good prescription like you can with normal eyes. with kc, things can get better, then worse, then better again as they try a series of lenses. your doctor may have to spend time just jumping around trying to find the magic combination of sphere and cylinder power that works for you. you need someone who finds this interesting and is willing to spend the time playing with things. it will help if you can book your appointment at a time when the office is less busy and ask that they give the doctor extra time to spend with you because of your kc. i have seen some surprisingly good result with glasses despite my kc. my doctors have sometimes let on that they were surprised too.",reddit,0,1

9201,it would be a good idea to get checked by your eye doctor. you may need to see a retina specialist based on what your eye doctor says. as we age the vitreous gel inside the eye starts to shrink and you might see floaters or white flashes. generally that happens with age. i was 49 when i started having that happen. sometimes it can cause a torn or detached retina. the good news is that a retina specialist can keep it from getting serious by fixing a tear with a laser. i had that and didn't have any problems with it and mine is stable now.,reddit,0,1

how could i live the way i would want her to be able to? i don't want to make it sound like it has all been an airy fairy /crystals and incense type experience either though, because there are some grounded practical steps i've taken to handle the stress and fears as well. 1. my rheumatologist put me on plaqunil while i was trying due to the literature showing that it quite possibly cuts the risk of heart block in half. it is my understanding this can be effective if started by 10 weeks. forewarning if you seek to be put on the medicine, you may get some push back because the studies have only been done on mothers that have already had a child with heart block, not first time mothers. my maternal fetal specialist said while they didn't think it was necessary, they considered the medicine safe and would go along with the rheumatologist. being on hcq has given me some added peace of mind. 2. i continued to see a counselor and have been able to talk with her about my fears and the pregnancy process as well as some of the darker feelings of blaming myself etc... this has been very helpful. 3. i enrolled in a research study for anti-ro positive mothers. the primary investigator of the study is one of the top researchers in this area (jill buyon out of nyu langone). the student is called stopbloq [ 1. basically they sent me an at home fetal doppler monitor and provided training videos and sample audio files of normal/abnormal heart rates. i then take a reading 3 times and day and send it over to them. if at any time something sounds out of the norm, i can text an on-call pediatric cardiologist who will review the audio file and let me know if i need to have an emergency echocardiogram. they linked me up with a research site in my state where i can go if necessary. having this added support has been an amazing blessing. 2. in summary, i hear her heartbeat 3 times a day in conjunction with the normal standard of care weekly echocardiograms at my local maternal fetal medicine specialist. hearing it before i go in makes it so much less scary... like ""oh my gosh what are they going to find this week"" type thing. 3. if you are in the usa and less than 18 weeks pregnant you may be able to enroll in the study if you are interested. there are some states without a participating site, but many states have one. 4. i got a better understanding of the reality of heart block. it is common amongst those of us with this autoantibody to know the 2%/16-20% numbers. 2% if you're a first time mom, 16-20% if your a mom who has already had a baby with heart block. but what i wasn't familiar with was... if it happens, then what. well, the fact is more babies with this type of heart block live than die. that is not to discount complications they can have nor the scary reality of the 20-30% who pass away. but it did help me to realize that the worst case scenario for a first time mom was a small percent of the already small percent if that makes sense. i really hope something in the long wall of text has been helpful for you. i know how awful and dark the feelings can be and i hope you can get some relief from them.",reddit,0,1

9661,"your doctor seems to be of the opinion that correcting the full amount may cause you to become overcorrected and have an eye drift postoperatively. since you're 23 years old that double vision that you would get from being over corrected wouldn't be something that you would get used to or go away on its own, unless your eyes eventually started to cross back and words again. if you wear glasses then prism can be added to your glasses to help correct the double vision if you were to have it after surgery otherwise you would have to cover one eye with an eye patch. the reason you don't have double vision right now is due to a phenomenon called suppression. your right eye is the one that turns in and it was probably like that since you were a little child going by the history that you gave. when you were little and your eye started turning in you would have initially had double vision and your brain would have basically turned your right eye off to avoid the double vision. turning that eye off is called suppression and it happens in the brain. children's brains have the ability to create suppression but adults brains do not. we lose the ability to do this somewhere around the end of the first decade of life. once kids start developing suppression they can also develop what's called amblyopia, which is a reduced visiob due to inactivity of the eye caused by suppression. suppression only affects part of the eye, called a scotoma. the part of the eye that's being turned off depends on if the eye is crossing in words are drifting out words. because your eye is crossing in there is a very specific part of the eye that's being turned off. if we were to realign your eyes and over-correct you so that your eye is now drifting outward it would be a different part of your eye that would be receiving stimulus. that part of the eye was never trained to turn off and the result would be that you would have double vision.",reddit,0,1

9681,"hope i'm not too late to this - i had a reply typed out within half an hour of posting and it just... didn't post? my wifi is terrible, so not surprising. here's what i wrote: another 24 year old year with a large part of her self-identity stemming from her intellectual prowess chiming in here. i've probably had sjogren's since i was 8, and hashimoto's before that. while brain fog hasn't been my *primary* symptom or even my tertiary symptom, it has been the one i have struggled emotionally with more than any other. i'm also working on my phd in physics, and so the brain fog has impacted my work quite substantially. looking back on the tail end of my four-year undergraduate experience, what i now know as the sjogren's brain fog started to kick in. it would manifest in the form of being unable to focus on anything for more than about 5 minutes when previously i could focus on something uninterrupted for 50+min stretches. on brain fog days, i wouldn't be able to retain new information, and any work i did would either be completed agonizingly slowly (like you said, hours for a single page of information), or that work would be riddled with errors. it was incredibly frustrating for those last two years of uni, and especially my last semester when it was most frequent and i had 3 senior projects to complete. it got worse when i started my phd two years ago. everything i learned my last two years of undergrad, including the base physics i need to do any higher-level work, has evacuated my brain because of the brain fog i had during undergrad. even worse, the brain fog days became more frequent, and the brain fog itself became more intense. i ended up having to go on medical leave in november 2019 because the previous 6 months had gotten so bad. i'd been hospitalized for other symptoms off and on in october, and the brain fog rendered me quite literally unable to do any work on my research. the best i can describe it is that my vocabulary almost entirely vanished. i could barely form coherent sentences. i couldn't read, partly because i had double vision constantly, and partly because my brain would get part way through a sentence and then fizzle out so completely that my vision would go entirely white, all my thoughts would completely scatter, and sometimes, in addition to forgetting what the sentence had contained up to that point, i'd forget where i was and my own name. the same ""words go white"" phenomenon, as i was able to succinctly and ineffectually describe it to my doctors, was also prevalent when i was writing, coding, or speaking. this meant i couldn't learn new ideas. i couldn't hold concepts in my head long enough to form connections or generate ideas. i couldn't do anything that would move my phd forward. hell, i couldn't even form thoughts like ""i'm hungry"" or ""my joints are very crunchy and it hurts a lot"" or ""i need to move this spoon to my mouth so i can get enough calories to not die."" it was really bad. while the only way to address my issues this last year was through medication, something that i understand isn't in the cards for you, the meds haven't completely helped the brain fog go away. i'm *still* on medical leave (thanks, covid), but i am trying to do some light work at home, and i've found some ways to get by. like with you, trying a series of strict regimens of diets and supplements did absolutely nothing for me, and exercise only serves as a stress reducer. valuable at times, but not a complete solution. instead, in order to compensate for the sjogren's brain fog, i use skills i learned from the brain fog i've experienced with hashimoto's for the last decade. when i feel the ever-present brain fog increasing in severity, i take a series of steps: 1) i make myself a cup of tea, no matter what i was doing before. i find that the tea and the process of making it helps me calm down emotionally, and as others have stated, your own stress can be your biggest obstacle with the brain fog. while making/drinking it, i prepare for the rest of my day as will be discussed in steps 2 and 3. 2) i think about how i can change my schedule for the rest of the day to be as non-physical as possible. doing lots of physical activity when the brain fog peaks makes me less able to do anything mental, so i try to adjust what my day holds to the best of my control to prioritize the mental tasks. where can i take a bus instead of walking or driving? do i have the budget and supplies to eat pre-prepared meals instead of cooking? can i skip my band or kung fu practice this evening? 3) i think about all the tasks i have for the rest of the day and the rest of the week. is there anything immediately due tomorrow that i have to power through? if so, i move that immediately to the top of my to-do list so i can complete it before the brain fog gets too overwhelming. then, i move anything that requires learning important information or writing papers to the bottom of my list so i can tackle them when the brain fog is less bad. more minor tasks i find i have success in during brain fog are menial and repetitive tasks, like number crunching, replying to daily emails, organizing my workspace and research items, and developing soft skills. 4) once i have a handle on how i can adjust my day, i make another cup of tea and move myself into a workspace that has at least one spot of a completely bare, white wall or ceiling easily visible from where i sit. when the brain fog starts becoming overwhelming and stressful while i work, i stare at that blank spot for a while and do my best to think of nothing because the lack of stimulation it provides clears my head. this makes me less stressed and makes the brain fog temporarily less invasive. some days, staring at that spot 3 minutes out of every hour is enough to stay productive. some days, i have to space out to it for half an hour at a time to accomplish anything. on bad days, sometimes i just lay down on the floor for a bit while i veg to the blank spot on the wall. 5) i keep tea and water readily available throughout the day, as well as small snacks. when the brain fog gets bad, i've found that taking a literal minute to disengage from my work and focus on the act of eating/drinking re-energizes my brain. i've found particular success switching back and forth between green tea, lemon and ginger tea, and hard ginger candies. 6) the second emotions start to come in, the second i start feeling frustrated at my brain instead of the work, i stop. walk away. go to the bathroom. stare at a blank wall in another room. go outside and listen to birds. whatever. just physically remove myself from the frustration until i am calm again. the only way to live and have any form of productivity with constant and persistent brain fog is to not let it rule my life. to live with it as a symbiote because it never really goes away, yes, but to not bow to it. some days are better, some days are worse, and i find doing these things allow me to let my brain rest throughout the day while still feeling as though i'm productive amd proactive. i think it works because these tasks focus on clearing my head to prevent me from wallowing in the stress and depression. with sjogren's, stress is one of the biggest factors in worsening a flare. it can be tough to acknowledge the internal stress brain fog causes, and so incredibly easy to write everything off as ""if only i work harder, i'll be better."" my ability to function increases a thousandfold when i listen to my brain instead of my stress and insecurity. if my brain doesn't want to work, i don't work. i stare at a blank wall or listen to music or go for a walk or make tea, whatever feels right in the moment, and i trust my brain will tell me when it is ready to work again. it never takes my brain as long to rest and recover as the voice of fear in my head screams at me that it will. also, when the resource you depend on more than anything else for your identity and your career fails you continuously, it is hard not to experience depression. like someone said earlier, it's not a depression as we generally think of it per se because you know what's causing it, but the constant undercurrent of fear, not knowing if your brain will fail you so completely that you have to change who you are at your core and so that you'll never be able to do any of your favorite activities again, is harrowing. it's trauma. listen to your body. it knows best. in a way, i'm lucky my brain fog started at 15, because i was able to learn how to listen to my body in order to combat brain fog while in the safety net of easy classes and no bills. it's harder when you're older and there are real-life consequences. also, since you asked if people had success at dealing with brain fog and if there was any hope, let me tell you about my last semester of undergrad. my brain fog and other health issues were so bad i barely left my room, and at one point i had to get dean approval to take two weeks off. the entirety of that two week break, i laid in bed, dozing and staring at a blank wall and thinking of nothing, while star trek talked at me in the background 24/7 and my wonderful, amazing housemates brought me food and water. because i let myself rest, i succeeded in keeping top grades, earning highest honors on my cognitive science undergrad thesis and physics senior research project, getting a paper published on a project unrelated to either major, organizing and running the first ever science conference for undergrads at the united nations after 2 years of work, winning a competition to shadow the uk-nyc consul general and uk ambassador to the un for a few days, and graduating.",reddit,0,1

12261,"my breakup made my social anxiety worse - when you have social anxiety you kinda feel like everyone dislikes you,i know that but that's not what this is about. i had a bad breakup almost two years ago, while i was dating he was my pillar and my social anxiety reduced significantly and i was able to make a lot of friends and have normal pleasant interactions with people. i was spontaneous, funny, and even outgoing for a while. but more than anything i felt authentic and i loved myself a lot. since the breakup i'm worse than i've ever been. i feel like i'm in danger everywhere i go and everyone is judging me, and even if i go out with people i've known for years, i'm too terrified to talk and i just sit there like a doll. i just smile and wave and if i do talk i rehearse what i wanna say countless times in my head and most of the time i just end up giving up and staying quiet. when i'm leaving home to meet my friends i always have bad anxiety attacks and i often have to hide in the bathroom for a while when i get to the meeting spot. because of all this rehearsing i do in my mind i think i might come off as someone who isn't authentic and that worries me. my ex was like a protective barrier between me and the world and i dated him from 15 to 21 years old, i'm trying to learn how to function and it's been terrifying. getting back together isn't an option and i want to be able to function properly and be happy without needing to have someone who i feel ""has my back"" or something. i want to be confident on my own. but i'm so scared and anxious that i'm paralyzed. no one knows my situation, i never shared it with anyone, my father has social anxiety too but we aren't close. i feel like i should get help because it's keeping me from living my life, but the idea of sitting down and talking to a stranger is scary. and i feel like i would be wasting their time too. i don't know how to get out of this :( any suggestions in what i should do to make this better? do you have the same issues? how do you deal with it",reddit,0,1

12317,"[relevant]( alright mr. durden, while i agree with your overall point and strive to live this way myself, in my opinion you're omitting something very important, which sort of contradicts your argument. &gt;lose all hopes of being better, and you're suddenly free. yeah, but there are two outcomes of this. one, you gradually overcome all your fears and become the person you want to be, as you said, but two--you become depressed and then suicidal. i know because this is where i am now. i've always been a very ambitious individual with hopes and dreams, especially in regards to my career, but in the past couple of months i've fallen into a downward spiral of depression. i *have* lost all hope. i have none. i honestly think i'm gonna die before i reach the age of 25. there's just no way a person like me can survive. everything i do is detrimental to either my physical or my mental health. i've accepted that i'm always going to be in this awkward, uncomfortable and confusing position of wanting a certain kind of life, wanting to be so much more, to experience certain things, while also being unable to take any kind of action to achieve these things out of anxiety and fear, which, sadly, has been hardwired into my brain since birth. i'm not suicidal right now, but i have been before, and if i don't end up dying of some untreated illness or in some kind of accident in the next few years i think the most probable outcome is that i'll become legitimately suicidal and kill myself. by losing all hope, you are free from the fear of death, and free to take your own life. this is why losing all hope is bad. you even say &gt;don't just be that person, want to be that person. so in that case, if you want to be this person, you still have some hope left. losing every single ounce of hope within you literally means just being the person you are without caring who that is because there's zero drive left in you. if recovery is a road and not a place, then not having any drive to be a certain person will leave you stuck on the side of the road. you will go nowhere for the rest of your life and you will die in the exact same spot you're in now. instead...accept who you are now, lose all your optimism and pessimism and become a realist, take a look at the person you want to be, and completely ignore everything else. don't be one of seven billion cars driving down recovery road, be [this badass motherfucking high-octane 18-wheeler]( and plow the other cars off the road without looking back, without checking your mirrors, crashing into everything as you head toward a treacherous, deadly sandstorm, and appreciate what a day, what a lovely day it is.",reddit,0,1

12564,"how is your anxiety with other stuff? like are you able to go shopping, make a doctor's appt, etc. if that stuff is still too hard, def try those ""baby steps"" first so that you feel more confident about putting out applications. usually retail/ups/fedex/amazon/doctor's offices are where young people your age first start working. start with making a resume, though honestly some places like amazon don't even require a one! i also have severe sa and i started working at a grocery store when i turned 18. it's been almost 3 years and i'm still there. it's been hard and shitty at times, but it's seriously so worth it. at least do it for the money lol making money is awesome! all it takes is just looking up stores in your area and putting in an online application. try to avoid fancy household names and fashion stores since those kinds of stores tend to have actual standards for their employees. walmart and other random grocery stores (besides trader joes and whole foods) are usually not picky and it's very easy work. fast food and fashion can be easy depending on the chain, but def get the vibe of the employees first. some chains have terrible turnover and it shows if every employee is just super rude and miserable. decent places will have generally normal, polite employees. if you want some practice, you can try calling some places and asking them directly if theyre hiring. trust me only maniacs would respond rudely to that question! if anything they'd just say ""we arent hiring right now""/""call again when the managers here""/""its all online."" if they say theyre hiring, ask how you can apply and any next steps that they recommend. usually calling and following up on an application can show interest. i know my boss sometimes doesn't look at apps until she gets called about it. if you go in person and make sure to look nice and friendly, it'll be even better. you can get a sense of the vibe of the employees and maybe some useful tips and advice from them. in low-wage jobs honestly the interviews are rarely as high-stakes as the internet makes you believe. mine was literally just getting my papers in and picking my hours. just be positive, be clean, act normal, and don't say that you hate customers or have problems with being late. definitely don't mention shyness or other personal issues. it's really so much easier than it sounds! and once you get the job it really just becomes a routine like any other. it's totally worth trying and you'll probably improve your sa a ton if you take the plunge and see what happens!",reddit,0,1

(i'm under 18) -how did you acquire inderal? did you have to talk to an anxiety specialist and get a prescription, or can you ask your regular doctor (pediatrician in my case) for a prescription, explain your situation, get it and leave? or, can you even walk into a pharmacy and get some after explaining why you could use some, and would the inderal in that case be covered by insurance? thank you very much for any answers.",reddit,0,1

12747,"want to use social media, but can't get myself to. - not sure if it'd just me, but throughout the years, i've wanted to actively use social media but i can't seem to get myself to go through with it. not even sure if there's even a question i'm trying to ask or if i'm just looking for advice in general. &amp;#x200b; have had facebook and instagram for years. never posted a single thing on them except for replying to dm's and the odd 'happy birthday' message. no profile pictures, statuses. nothing. maybe a part of the problem is that, due to be being in my early 20's now, it'd feel weird to suddenly start posting all of a sudden. one work colleague suggested taking a 365 picture challenge and continuously post on insta/faceook. however, i think that'd annoy most people, plus with the backup assurance that one of my close friends said that it annoyed him when someone else tried something similar. &amp;#x200b; anyone else had any experience/ advice with this sort of predicament? i suppose in the end, i'm after advice.",reddit,0,1
12773,"stop focussing on yourself. switch your attention to what everyone else is doing. it's simple but effective. my therapist told me to do this and it actually works. it's not an instant fix. it takes time, but it will reduce your sa. basically you just need to stop feeding it. stop putting the spotlight on you. stop thinking the negative thoughts you normally think. just let your anxiety run its course. and mate stop smoking weed until you do reduce it. i smoked for 18 years or so and stopped earlier this year. it helps trust me!",reddit,0,1

12808,"i met my husband online through a friend. we've been together for 16 years and he is literally the only person i feel i can be myself around. it's been like that since the beginning. at first he thought i needed help opening up to people more, so he made a point to include me in conversations whenever he could. while i appreciated that, it wasn't always comfortable to me. as we both matured (we met when we were 16) i found the courage to have an open conversation with him about my social reservations. he listened patiently and sympathetically. in the years since he's developed the ability to identified when i am uncomfortable in a social situation and helps me make a dignified retreat. i'm forever grateful to him for respecting the space i need, even if he doesn't totally understand it.",reddit,0,1
12818,"you're making fun of people with anxiety, but you admitted you have anxiety yourself. you said you feel sick and want to stay indoors. how sad! you admitted to yourself that your an uneducated 20 year old. you said you love care work but you act like this. you said you started to hang around the right people in your life but your clearly haven't since your acting like this. oh... how was that abusive relationship that you've been in for years? abused you were huh? not surprised with this character. you make fun of people with social anxiety but you admitted to yourself that you don't want to talk anymore. you said if you could never speak ever again you think you'd be happier. literally anxiety... you said you get stressed about grammar. you admitted to having shit grammar and that you feel discomfort...awww. 20 years old... how sad? you say people with social anxiety are little bitches but the honest truth is... you are the bitch... abused little mentally ill bitch. how sad!",reddit,0,1
12835,"yes it will be terrible so get help early and don't wait until you're like 20 like i did. luckily i had a few short periods of fun so i don't feel like i totally missed out, but for the most part i didn't enjoy college and my early 20s at fucking all. worst years of my life for sure since it's all about being independent and social which i did not do at all since i was so frozen from my anxiety, figuratively and literally. as far as keeping down a job, you'll definitely be able to keep down a job that doesn't require a ton of social interaction. depending on how gritty you are, you might be able to stick with a job that does require more social interaction long enough to improve. if you're prone to quitting when things get tough, you're fucked. just keeping it real. don't wind up like me. lol",reddit,0,1
12916,"sheltered childhood (m20), left home last year to a new city and feel like a man-child - first post on reddit so please bear with me so...i have been sheltered and coddled my whole childhood by parents with good intentions and a horrible understanding of the possible outcomes. first of all, a bit of backstory. my parents marriage is fairly dysfunctional (mom has huge emotional baggage but also is effectively taking care of my dad emotionally - hes even worse). this has led to a pretty unstable home where everyone was always walking on eggshells and only positive emotions were acceptable. i never rebelled against this and always stayed the good kid, which was great for keeping our dysfunctional family dynamic together but horrible for making friends or developing a shred of confidence or self respect. i love my parents and i understand now that they were both doing what they thought was right at the time (even though resentment towards them pops up every now and then, which im trying to improve). unfortunately, because of always acting like the nice little kid and never experiencing people dislike me or get mad at me (openly at least - cant say whether or not that was different behind my back), i now feel like this underdeveloped child in a young mans body. hell, even the 15 yo kid i work with is more emotionally stable and confident than i am. i am so scared of conflict, people judging me, and people thinking im a bad person that i feel like theres this whole side of myself that is completely undeveloped, making me feel like an immature, pathetic little kid even though im technically an adult. i have been working with my therapist to gain more self-compassion (i.e. stop thinking of myself as an immature pathetic little kid) but i guess what im really hoping for is advice on how to deal with pushing past being over sensitive and learning how to develop my rough side and stand up for myself. also, the constant pain of embarrassing myself by panicking under the smallest of issues when the teenagers im working with are relaxed is almost unbearable at times. if anyone has any advice, personal stories, or questions please feel free to respond. thank you very much for listening and for any input you might have! :)",reddit,0,1
12923,"maybe a better way to put it is that its better to get out of your own way. ive battled my anxiety for a good 20 or so years. its never significantly got better. some progress has been made but not what one might think would be during this time. ive come to realize that i have a certain amount of anxiety. it just is what it is. it doesnt matter how much i fight it, its still going to be here. realizing and accepting that as a fact has allowed me to get out of the way. it doesnt matter what i think, its just a part of me as much as my hand or foot. its not a good or bad thing. i never chose to be this way. its not my fault i feel this way. obviously if i had a button to push and change it then i would in a heartbeat. theres no reason to beat myself up for it. its not my fault that i feel this way. why would i beat myself up for something that isnt my fault. the same goes for my thoughts. where do my thoughts come from? where/how does a thought originate? its not necessarily my fault for the thoughts the come into my head. at far as i can tell, they come out of thin air. if i could, i would gladly push a button to only have positive thoughts. no reason to beat myself for something i cant control. once that these realizations have really set in, i noticed that all of these feelings, emotions, and thoughts ive previously fought so much against have finally started to fade and in a sense im becoming more capable. im not sure any of this will ring true with you but its where i am now. i can honestly say that i am happier and less anxious the more i accept myself.",reddit,0,1
